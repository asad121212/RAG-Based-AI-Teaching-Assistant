    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai Aur Code and welcome to our official launch of our playlist Chai Aur Django You have shown a lot of support on Twitter, LinkedIn and everywhere and thank you so much for that and this reminds me of our... let's discuss our comment target first initially everyone starts but the problem is who goes till the end in the series that is the one who comes out in the end everyone else comes to explore but no worries, even if you come to explore you are ahead of a lot of people so let's keep this video's target of 600 comments comment quickly I will feel good if you show support so let's start our Django series and as you know I like to write code directly so we will start with code editor but before that let me tell you a small thing that sit comfortably with tea I will try to explain things more and slow down but actually in Python Django you will see that things develop so easily and fast that I will not be able to slow them down even if I want to it's not that you won't understand you will understand and you will be able to do it on your system but it is so fast and it goes so easily that I won't be able to contribute much it will run at speed that's why Django is called an expert framework of rapid development and it is a very mature framework don't compare this framework with any other framework especially if you are coming from a JavaScript background the things you have seen in JavaScript Nest or NextJS or Gatsby or whatever you have seen don't compare them here it is a completely different framework yes, if you are coming from a Laravel background or Ruby on Rails then you can compare a little but not much so let's start first we will set up the environment and then I will tell you how to do it don't forget to comment let's go we will come to our screen sharing we will come to Django later first we will come to our VS Code there is not much in VS Code we keep the theme as Chai we always go with the same theme and in this I will drag and drop a folder which is called ChaiDjango it is just an empty folder with this I will show you the entire environment setup we will also open a small terminal today my keyboard is troubling me I don't know why it has been doing this since morning ok we need a terminal and a folder that's it now whenever you are in Python first of all we will do a little bit of Django what is it, where is it, how is it what will be the benefit of us will anything happen or not so see what is Django it makes it easier to build better web application more quickly and less code you have comparatively less code in the quantity it is easy, there is already shrinked code in Python so it is very less and it is scalable, very fast it is useful for rapid development about Django, what you will see while talking it will be ridiculously fast yes, no word can be compared to this it is ridiculously fast apart from that reassuring the security I will show you many security features in Django like SRF protection many protections are there by default you have to write code according to those protections Django by default protects it which is a good thing apart from that exceedingly scalable ok by the way I will tell you a small story about Django in Django you get a very good scale on minimum systems in the system of JavaScript or the applications comparatively you need a little more RAM or a good system but these applications like Django and other old frameworks it scales very well on bare minimum so if you have a $5 machine or $10 machine it still has the power to handle many users at the same time so yes it earns less bill, that's why corporates like Django a lot in fact you may not know that Django is used in such places it is also used in Paytm we will not discuss so many things so this is our basic about Django now when you come for Django you will think that I should go to download and install it on Mac or Linux python-m pip install django it is ok if they give this version or not I should go to windows and do it like this but the development of python is done in this way professionally especially because no one expects that you keep a specific version of python everyone wants to do the development in a separate environment or in a separate box for that in python virtual environment is used where there is a separate instance or a separate sandbox where all our code will go what is installed on our main system does not make a big difference to the virtual environment so that's why you will see everyone making a virtual environment in python now I will tell you the commands of virtual environment and I will also tell you how we will do it don't run it now listen to the whole thing so if you are on windows you can start here with the py command I am on mac or you are on linux so we already have python 2 so we write all the commands with python 3 so this is very basic I told you in the python series that whenever I write python 3, you write py now you will often see what to do to make a virtual environment dash m today the keyboard is bothering a lot ok so we put dash m here and then you write that I want a virtual environment so venv we have this venv so this is the command that virtual environment gives and the virtual environment will be in the install folder so people often do it in the .venv folder this dot is because the way our git is a dot folder in the same way all the settings of the virtual environment files in a dot or hidden folder people often like to keep it in a hidden folder this is the only thing to do nothing else how to activate it is the same but what I will use here is a little different what I am going to use is called uv there are many ways to install uv you can also install pip install uv or if you are on any other system then you can install it from pip pipx, brew and many more you can also run this command on the windows power shell and the thing is why? why do we want to use uv? if you compare it with the javascript environment then like npm, all the work is done from it and pip also but there we have bun which is very fast in the same way uv is my new favorite because it is an extremely fast package manager written in rust so not only in rust it has actually worked on a lot of parsers and it is very fast you can see the speed difference 0.06 vs there are many graphs like this but in the right sense you will see that there is a lot of speed difference so like you installed python run any of these commands run pip or if you are on mac then run pip3 or then install brew you will have one of these commands search just pip and you will get it now after that if you ever want to make a virtual environment then pip vnv just this much work we have to do you don't have to give anything else it automatically does all the work so now what i will do because uv is already installed so i will use that uv please uv and after that i will write here that i want a virtual environment so we will write the same venv so it will give us the virtual environment venv so as you wrote, your virtual environment is created now the file we got here has the same exact thing that you normally get from the first command so we have bin, python 3.11 is installed bin is also there, all the activation libraries that you get, all of them are with you there is no problem now what we have to do is run this activate script whether you are in windows or mac you have to run this script then your virtual environment will activate now you just installed it so we have the activation command here by the way, you will get a full blog in the description you don't have to read all of this i have written everything in detail check the description so if you are on mac you have to use the source so you can activate in the bin in this environment if you are on windows, you can directly activate the scripts in the dot if you are on activate, it will be in the script or in the bin, wherever it is, we have to go there and activate it so let's do this so we have the source and after that we have to go to dot vnv and we have bin and activate this is the command as soon as you install this command or activate your script so we have here, source ok, typo small typo here, source so now what i can see here dot vnv is on my command line this means that you are in the virtual environment and nothing else, whenever you want to deactivate you can type deactivate and your virtual environment will be deactivated ok, so this is done let's reload it is getting hang ok so let's do this, i think my machine needs a restart because it has not restarted for a long time ok we will talk about it after the video so this is done all the installation is done now one more thing you have to remember if you want to install anything, you have to do it like this uv, then pip install whatever you want to install, if we want to install django we will see how to do that but wherever it is mentioned pip or pip3 now you are in the virtual environment because we have made a virtual environment from uv and uv pip then install whatever you want to install ok, so you have understood that we have to install uv pip ok, so let's go to the second one how to do it so here it is mentioned that you can install django like this if it is a specific version, then do that otherwise you can do django let's see how to install it so we have been told that you can type pip sorry, you have to type uv first uv, then pip, not pip3 even if you are on mac, you have to type pip because you are in a virtual environment so the problem of 3 has been solved and after this you have to type directly that you have to install the keyboard is troubling me a lot I have to restart the system install and you have to type django d is the capital of django so as soon as you enter django will be installed it installs ridiculously fast and all the dependencies have come to you ok, django is installed now what to do next now nothing special we will use django to make a project before that let's read here that django has more ways by the way, the documentation you will get in this is next level I will say that in comparison to anyone not only javascript, in comparison to anyone the documentation of javascript community whether it is fastapi or django is on a ridiculous level they write documentation on the next level they don't leave any space whether there is a problem or not and documentation is really next level they write more markdown files than python why? because I personally know the founder of fastapi and many times I have done a podcast with him he also says this whenever it is said that we write more markdown files than python so whenever you want to see something you can see in the overview they write the documentation the code, format, files they write it very well now we come to make a simple python project so now we go to python and say let's make a django project in this virtual environment now when you make a django project there are chances of some confusion but it won't happen why? because you have come on code so what we do now because you have django installed so you can use django dash admin so this django admin is a command which is installed after installing django now here are 2-3 sub commands one is the main command after that the first command we learn is start project there are two commands first time you use the project command after that you don't use it after that in django multiple small apps are made for now we just have to start the project so what we do is chai and django ok chai and django I wrote now I entered and I got chai and django project now the most confusing thing is that when you open it there will be another folder so you will think that if you write dot here then we will get this folder no no you don't want to do this whenever django project is made in python then a sub folder should be made in it our main project should be like this this is standard practice that in virtual environment and at this level we should have django project whatever name you have given so we have chai and django now in this you will see a manage.py file so first of all go to this folder and go to chai and django now as soon as I am lessing I am seeing a file named manage.py so let's run it so the simple way to run it is run this file through python so we have python manage.py and we will give a sub command to it which is run server as soon as you give run server command you will see some errors we will not worry about them now in the coming videos we will discuss in detail what is admin auth content type sessions we will ignore it for now we will not see it in this video now what is here you have watching file servers, challenges, system checked identified, no issues you have everything here and you can see a db escolite is also being created here so db escolite is created oh I have a small error that port is already using it so maybe somewhere because it is a very common port it is running somewhere yes, it was running in my second application I stopped it let's run this command again because mostly when I make backends of javascript I run it on 8000 and python is also run by default on this port by the way, in case you also face a situation that our server or default port is blocked so we can also solve this it is very easy you can give port number after this suppose this is 8001 so you can give 8001 good, one more error so now what we do we run this ok we know that localhost is run by default on 8000 so we come here and open it in a new tab so please copy it ok copy copy copy it should have been done directly but today because our keyboard is facing some issues this is your first django it's dark mode is not yet available so this is your django application you are seeing this page because your debugging is true if debugging is false then you will not see this page now we come to the point that we have turned on all the functions but now we come to the point where all this came from so we will do a little file exploration how django works and that's it in next video we will go in more detail but for now only file exploration is important first file is your manage.py this is your starting point file and this is the file that will set many things from your environment variables in fact after going to production this is the file that invokes your system and this is the file that runs in this file you have many options which we see on the server so manage.py one more thing to keep in mind in python now we will make many folders and you should know exactly where is the indentation of that folder that where is the level of that folder manage.py is the level in python it is talked about in production or inside folder is its level this is called our project level after this comes the app level one is your root level and in manage.py the level where is the file there only some files or folders are made this is the framework, rules are there we can't keep the name of files and folders nor we can dump files and folders anywhere we want there are specific rules if you create files and folders there then expected behavior is there then we have esquilite 3 why esquilite 3 because this is the default database which is used in django now the best thing is that whatever code you write here it has nothing to do with esquilite, mysql, postgres you can write any code just a few lines and not even code you can set the configuration and move from esquilite to postgres from postgres to mysql in fact in django no sql databases also works very well but the common practice is that we mostly stay in sql databases but you don't have to interact with sql databases you don't have to write sql now let's go to this folder this is our project folder in this folder we do a lot of basics mostly we make a separate app which we will make in the next video and work through it now you know if you have seen python series then you have cache folder whenever there are multiple modules of python then you have cache folder which gives optimization we had discussed this a lot earlier after that the main file which is very important is settings.py here all the configuration of django is written here who should I consider in base directory what are your secret keys this is used in production debugging true what all host is allowed after installing this will be very useful as i said django has a small app like suppose you are making ecommerce then django will make a small app although it can interact but coupons are made into a separate app products categories are made into a separate app checkout is made into a separate app so that multiple people can work and logic is separate so we add additional middleware is also very powerful you get so many middleware by default in which you have authentication and protection from clickjacking all this is out of the box and by the way we will see how big admin panel you get in django without doing anything and it is a very good admin panel we will also come to templates how to do templating this is our database section we are dealing with escolite 3 but eventually we will also deal with postgres after that your password authentication validation is by default timezone language code we will come to this later so you understood the settings file if you want to do any setting on project level then you can come to settings.py file there are not many settings you just configure them after this, you will go to a common file which is urls.py this is your routing file, where you can go now you can see here admin is already a route but it is not configured if you go here, you will not get anything special for that you have to run a few more commands which we will run in the next video but admin is by default yes, admin dashboard here we do routing of all the files routing means which url you will go what will happen after going to the url we will discuss that in a separate file that file is not here we have to make that file first time if it is here, views.py views.py defines all our views views means controller all the functionality, business logic all that is dealt here similarly, model is also made which we will make eventually where we keep all the database models so this is how jango application works first of all, you hit this url file means you hit a url so this url file governs which route will handle it so once the route is handled then the control of our file goes on views in views, you write business logic and you can return from there you can return html file or just hello world or whatever you want to return apart from that, how things will be structured in database how it will be, all that work we do in models.py file those files are not there yet, eventually but now i don't want to burden you from day 1 that you feel it is overwhelming because once you see it, you will feel that it is a very rapid development so for now, we have explored a file structure and for now, i am keeping it a little light so that you feel that we have made at least a project understood the file structure that it is not that big there were 3-4 files we understood them we saw 1-2 commands our jango application is running we saw where the debugging true came from that's it for now, we will do this much because we will keep it a little light and in the coming videos, we will see how we can work more in these applications how we can do custom templating static files, database, a lot more as you know, we take things to production level we go full in depth we explore we learn good practices we learn production grade things so don't forget to comment and target and share the series and we will meet you in the next video we will write a little more code in the next video so keep watching and we will meet you in the next video till then subscribe"
