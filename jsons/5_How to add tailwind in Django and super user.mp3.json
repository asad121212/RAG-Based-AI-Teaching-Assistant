Welcome to Chai and Code And the best part is Thank you so much for all the comments And back to back comments You have kept the motivation at the peak And that's why we are doing so much So welcome to Chai and Django This video is a part of our Django series We bring a lot of series on our channel We don't just make Gyan Roadmap We like to make series, complete projects And full courses So that's what we do If you are new to our channel, please subscribe If you are old, then our target for this video is 350 comments Please do it within 24 hours It's a lot of fun I read all the comments I scroll comments more than Reels Let's move on What we will do in this video We will elevate Django a little bit Because dumping things suddenly Is not a solution It's not a way to teach The way to teach is to have fun So let's learn new things We will learn two new things First, how to use Tailwind CSS In Django And second is an admin panel As soon as the admin panel comes You will get to know about the power Why are there so many fans of Django So we will come to that too That's a small thing, admin panel It doesn't even take 2 minutes The problem is in Tailwind And often in Django courses Tailwind is not included In fact, you will see in paid courses Tailwind is not included And it's not their fault Because the setup is a little complicated And often with Django Front end development is less Basically, you can inject bootstrap Or material UI But you know We raise the level So we will go to Tailwind And it's not easy Because the installation instructions Are a little muddy on the website So, if you have any questions You can see in the comment section The whole article is step by step So that you can come again It's good if you watch the video Our views will only increase But in case you have to see a few things You can see from that article There is nothing wrong with that I won't agree So let's go to you first How to install Tailwind In Python, there are many packages Like in Node, there are thousands of packages One package is Django Tailwind This package works But the installation Is not that easy The second problem is This pip We are using UV UV is in Rust It's ridiculously fast But I have not seen UV on production And in fact, I came to know When you bring third party packages There is an issue of UV So, this package is not 100% compatible It's a new package So, we will see We have made our virtual environment With UV Now, there is no pip directly in UV If you have made a virtual environment From Python, then it's fine But we will not leave it We will come here And install pip in our virtual environment So that we have both UV and pip We will try to go ahead with pip So that stability is maintained So, let's come here This is our VS code Which is used every time By the way, tell me in the comment section Have you commented or not First, we have to activate the virtual environment Let's try it You have Chai and Django And here is my virtual environment So, first of all, because I am on Mac I have told you a different command If you don't remember, then go to documentation Or go to our blog article It's very easy, you have to go directly to it So, I have to go to .venv There is a bin and a file Activate Now, my Virtual environment is activated Now, after the virtual environment is activated Yes, it's a little hot My throat is dry So, our virtual environment is activated This is a small sign that yes, the virtual environment is activated Now, I want to install it Now, let's see this problem We were doing uv and pip install We were doing it this way It was happening very easily But here, as we run it Now, it's running I think, my first issue was happening But, if it's installed, then it's not a good thing Okay, maybe I did something wrong I will update in the documentation That we have it We have installed one more package And we have to install it We have to install one more package Now, see, that other package It doesn't have any requirement But, you will like that package Because, in Tailwind We want that, as soon as I save And write anything in the template, it will automatically Upload on the website There is no hot reload yet There are different packages in Django for hot reloading But, we take it with this So, that our work becomes easy We have to do some configuration So, for that, what we do In Tailwind, with this You get one more package But, for that, first, put it in quotes And then, put a square bracket And you have to write reload Here, reload, close the square bracket And then, put an exclamatory This is important As soon as you enter this Now, see, here is a small problem Audited one package This was not required That's why I said, that sometimes, UV was giving me a problem And this is the problem Because, we don't want audited one package We want to install that package Otherwise, there will be issues So, the thing is, this is done But, tell me the solution of the problem Now, the solution of the problem is You have to install pip I will tell you two commands to install pip One of them will definitely work for you It depends on where you are In which system you are So, I will tell you First, after Python, dash m And then, there is a command, ensure pip So, as soon as you give the command, ensure pip After that, write dash dash upgrade If you give this command Then, 70-80% chances That your installation will be done If you don't have pip Then, there is one more command Which works almost 100% So, that command is very simple Python dash m After that, take pip and install it That's it And we can upgrade it by hand Here, upgrade And pip So, with this, pip should be installed Python dash m I can't do it with this command So, I will go to the previous command Now, it will depend on which command you are So, we go to ensure pip And dash dash upgrade So, That's why I told you both the commands Because, many times, there are edge cases And, rely on one command If it is not working, then I check it on multiple test cases These commands That's why, I take more time To make courses and videos Because, I verify all these personally That's why, I take time And tell you different scenarios So, that you can do it well Now, we have pip installed So, now, the package Which I was installing, I can do it directly So, UV is not working So, we remove UV and install pip Now, I can do pip install in my virtual environment And UV UV was cutting edge That's why, I used it But, yes, pip is used in production So, now, I enter it And, I think, still we have an issue Command not found pip It shouldn't have come Ok Ok, setup tool Requirement already satisfied You have pip in virtual environment It shouldn't have happened Issues like this Pip install Let's see more Dash dash upgrade Pip It should have worked Let's see I think, now, we have I had to run both the commands Because, there are many dependencies in the system We keep on messing in virtual environment Let's try again I won't avoid or edit these things So, you can see the struggle Let's see pip install Django Hopefully, now, it's installed You also saw the struggle But, it's important to see That's why, I wrote both the commands You can find both the commands in the blog Already found Now, we have pip installed We have seen shortcomings of UV And, we have Django tailwind And Django tailwind reload Both are installed Ok Now, we have to follow the instructions Through the instructions Their procedure And, the order is very important You can't do it separately First, I have to go to my main app Where I will get settings.py In this settings.py, I have to add an app So, now, I have Installed apps We have made a chai app And, one more app I will turn off the suggestions So, now, you have one app Tailwind Save it Now, once you have saved it We have to run a command It's a basic command We can't find python or manage.py So, we have to go to chai and django And, we have to tell python Please run manage.py But, how to run it? You have to start tailwind So, you have to give tailwind init command As soon as you give tailwind init command Some packages will be downloaded It takes some time to download these packages But, at last, you will be asked What name-up do you want to give to your app You can choose any name Like theme, tailwind, whatever I will go to default So, I will keep theme Now, what happened is You have a new folder You can see it here I don't have any option to zoom But, you have What option do you have? But, it will hide behind me But, you will know that theme is here Now, because you have theme You have to install one more app You have to install theme app So, you have to enter comma And, tell that theme app is here Ok You have to do some more work You have got theme app But, you have to write some more configuration By the way, you will get all these In documentation And, I have written easy documentation In article description So, you can get used to reading documentation So, after that You have to do some small settings You have to tell your app name So, tailwind underscore app Underscore name Now, how will you tell your name? Whatever name you have put I have put theme, so I will put theme You have put superman, so you will put superman You have put nagraj, so you will put nagraj After that, you have to give one more small thing By the way, you don't need other apps But, because we are going to run two servers So, we have to tell What is our internal IP So, we get an option here Underscore IPs And, nothing in this We will tell in arrays So, we know that we have 127.0.0.1 Dot one Dot one So, these are the arrays You can write it But, keep in mind about spellings This is internal IP And, this is IPs So, you have to enter IPs This is first string If you have any other domain Which already works in production and industry If you have any domain Then, add domain mapping Ok We have done this work Now, what we have to do Now, this much work, we have to do Now, we have to do Through manage.py We have to install tailwind Now, your app has come This is the biggest feature of Django That you have everything Like a folder Almost everything I just have to install it So, we go here and install it How to install it It is very easy Call manage.py And install it That's it It takes some time Especially, when you are recording It takes more time Because, I already use a lot of resources During recording So, it will be fast for you If you are on good internet Ok, we have done this work Package has been installed Now, here You can go completely and use tailwind Now, there are some small issues I will tell you Because of that, I found this documentation a little weird Ok, now what you can do If you see this theme carefully Opening it, we have a folder named templates And we have base.html In base.html You will see only two new things Load static tailwind tags And tailwind css What they have done They have given a base template Like we made a layout, some people call it a base It is the same thing, call it layout or base And in that base If you want to inject tailwind Or inject it anywhere You can add it because of these two lines Line number 1 and line number 9 Because we already have our base template So, what I want to do I want to add it in the template So, I have this layout.html I go to the top and load static I add it from here So, I have the tailwind tags added And there is one more line Copy this tailwind css And add it here I add it under the style sheet You can also do it above But ok Now, hopefully I have all this Now I want to run the server And see if I have done the work or not If the work is done, then how is it done For that also, we will need a few things I want to introduce you to the errors We will get the errors now Let's see the errors So, now I have the errors here And the errors will come now First through python manage.py And the basic command is our run server Ok, we handle the run server So, I have to open this port Ok, so we open the port Let's do it in this browser Here we are Alright Everything is working There is no problem There is no problem, then the errors will come Don't worry, they won't go anywhere Now what I want to do Remove all the files Now I know that in layout.html Technically I can write tailwind Ok So, if tailwind is included here Then you will think that I can write it in index.html Yes, technically you should write So, the first problem I have Is the class And I want Now see who remembers the tailwind classes So, I said bg-orange Orange And 400, 500 Ok, I am getting suggestions from tailwind intelligence In case if you don't have it Then tell me the solution We tell all the solutions And let's make it large So, text-3xl Let's see what's the problem It's not working Let's reload So, it's clear that we don't have background color Why? Because it's not generated Now to generate it You will need one more terminal So, let's start one more terminal And we can Do it in virtual environment You can do it in virtual environment But not like that We will need virtual environment So, let's turn it on Same simple source And after source I think I need to go to folder And after that Source And .venv I think ls-la I think I came to wrong directory I need to go to one directory back Ls, yes, it's here So, wherever your source is .venv And activate This virtual environment is also activated I will rename it Otherwise You can use these techniques Otherwise you will also get confused I will call this terminal as tailwind And you can give it color if you want So, change color And we will give it green So, I will know That tailwind terminals Increase productivity So, I will use it Now, my server is running Now, I need to start tailwind So, I need to call it Python And manage.py It's not available here So, I will go to manage.py And after that I need to call it tailwind start So, Tailwind is continuously Building And we need it Now, let's reload it It's not available yet Why? Because in this condition You need to restart it And you may see some errors So, I will close it And restart it So, I think now tailwind is generating I needed errors Technically But there are no errors Maybe you are using Environment variables But you will get 100% errors There is no exception So, what errors are we talking about? We need to go to settings And close it And after coming here You need to add one path Without that, it won't work That is npm bin path So, we need to come here And say that I need npm Underscore bin underscore path Now, how can you give npm bin path? It's very easy First, you need to search it To search, open a terminal Any basic terminal I always have warp So, let's open warp Whatever terminal you have You can run a simple command here var npm And you will get the path For windows You will get two paths One like this And one like this And you will get cmd You need that path So, copy it And paste it here Now, what is the problem? To run tailwind You need npm By the way, you need to install node You are on my channel If you are on windows I have given you a command Because what is the problem in windows? In windows, you will have this string But it will be like this It's forward slash This forward slash is a nightmare Not only this You will have something like this Program space files Now, files and space This is also a nightmare If you haven't come to linux system You will know how big nightmare Forward slashes and this So, what you will see That there are such strings and such paths Usually, they are not there on the system So, what we do there We have raw string And we replace them with double quotes So that it is okay In case if there is something So, I have given you that in documentation So, take care of it That there are such files And these are forward slashes Whatever you have I will comment it for now That it was only for windows users So, let's give it For windows users And I will comment it It's not necessary for me I am on mac If you are on windows, then come to linux Till when will you stay Now, what will happen In case if you don't have Tailwind Because tailwind is node based It generates everything from node So, now it will be easy for you In case if you are getting an error So, your error will be solved So, stop it once and start it again By the way, don't worry When you go to production You don't have to do anything Instead of start, you have to write That you want to build it So, it will be build and production grade will come to you So, don't worry about the experience It's not that I will tell you only half I will tell you the whole thing Okay, now you have done this much And now I go to index And if I make it blue Then hopefully we are getting changes But still I have to reload Now, what we do See, we have installed hot reloading So, now we make hot reloading Accessible Or we can say Configure settings So, close everything And see how it will be done Close everything for once Now, let's go to Chai and Django Settings.py Because everything will be done from here And after this, we have one more app Which we have installed So, we will bring this app Django Browser Reload Yes, this is the name of this app But install is same It is already given in documentation Now, not only this In one more documentation, you have Little middleware Now, see, we have not touched middleware much Obviously, we will touch it later But in this also, you have to go to end And keep it at end So, we add one more here Which is our simple Django Browser Reload.middleware.browser reload middleware Yes, it is very big And see these settings, no one will write These settings are usually copy pasted Either on documentation Or for blog article, you can copy paste from there Everyone keeps these settings Ok, this is done One more small thing, after that it will be done One final thing is you have to go to urls.py, which url? Project one, where you will see many comments Here, you have to enable One more path at last Always keep this path at last This is the path which Actually makes auto reload So, keep this at last Because it sends gzip So, this is little heavy path Because now you need hot reload When you put in production, you will remove hot reload This is not required in production There it is build, so there it never Comes to use, so don't worry about it Just whenever you make any other path Or apps, keep this at last This is the only requirement Now, we need to Restart everything Yes, there is no option for that This also needs to be restarted And this too, this is common mistake It has to be restarted Now, technically what we have Like you are in blue Now, I can close all this And after that we can go to Templates, website Index.html Close this, now instead of blue If I come to red So, hopefully we have red 500 And, it should have come on auto reload But for some reason It should have come Orange Yes, now hot reload has started Sometimes it takes 1-2 seconds But hot reload stays And after this, if we come to Text3.xl, what else we can do We can write more Suppose there is a paragraph In which there is a lorem, suppose there are 10 words And on this We add a class And we write the class Text Dash center Width, we also give width Dash How much should we give 5rem is enough And we also give bg Bg dash orange 400, we see Yes, our hot reload is going on Although we did not intend to give this But okay, we got to know that Hot reload is going on Okay, a lot of work is done A lot of work But okay Whatever you were learning in Django Which you had to express Now once the tailwind has come So, you can see all the skills you have learned In frontend, whatever it is You can bring all the skills here Copy paste, there is no problem Okay, this work is done Now let's close it Now let's go to our second work Which actually Make Django powerful That is Django's own admin panel This kind of admin panel Comes in many other frameworks Like it comes in Laravel And Django's framework Which is an admin panel, it is very famous I expected that in the JavaScript ecosystem Such admin panels will come They have not come now, but eventually in the future It is necessary Now this admin panel is highly configurable Looking at it in the first look, don't say That it looks very old school It is kept old school so that It remains the highest compatibility in all browsers And apart from this, it is not like It is like this, you can completely modify it You can inject your own CSS here You can do whatever you want to inject In fact, the way we got tailwind Similarly, Django's templates are also available Admin templates They are much easier to configure You just have to inject it directly One or two settings change and that's it Your whole admin gets revamped It is highly customizable And it talks directly to the model So you don't have to write any extra code for it You have to write one line And whatever model you have made, you get the crud functionality Which we will see in the coming video So now let's go back And see how we can Add it or start it Now first of all We come here, this is tailwind Let it run, let it run Now we come to our core error Which we have ignored so far Whenever we start running our command like this So I have told you to ignore one error You have 18 unapplied migrations The migrations They talk to your database Now we have an SQLite database But eventually there will be Postgres, MySQL You can put any database SQL, NoSQL, all work Now this 18 Tell me one thing It is so much fun to read You are watching videos so busy Isn't it that you tweet a little Comment, subscribe Listening very carefully But not this, taking a live class But not that we share Anyway, let's talk about it sometime Here see 18 unapplied migrations Migration means In Django You never write SQL directly Never talk directly to the database Django's ORM talks on your behalf So to talk about it We have two commands Now we will read one command We will read the second command It is very basic Go to python Manage.py does all the work We will read one command now The first command is migrate As soon as you migrate All the due migrations They have migrated To start the admin panel You needed authentication You also needed admin If all the tables are not there Then where will you log in So all the work is done Now when you run the command Run server You don't see any errors So we have talked about errors Now we come See hot reload is also running This work is also done Do we have admin now Yes, admin is there But there is a little more issue Now you can go directly to slash admin Why could I go to slash admin Because if you go and see In your project In urls.py You will see that It is already configured And here admin site urls So something is pre-cooked for you You have been given admin Go to slash admin And you will have admin Not only that, in settings.py There are many other things Which is databases Auth password validators Name, username Password validators Minimum length of passwords You get this by default You don't have to worry Although only super user can bypass These validations But other users can't If you want to do it, then configuration will be required Code will be required But see how much work has already come for you By default There are many other things We will also discuss about them Now let's read a few more commands First, stop We have stopped And cleaned Now we have to create a super user So come to python Manage.py And say create super user This is one word I type in it many times Hopefully you haven't done it yet As soon as you enter super user First your username is asked Either your system default My system name is apple I give it a name Login No need to give email address You can leave the field empty Or you can leave it empty Password It is very annoying Hitesh chai Enter Hitesh chai It says the password is very similar Bypass it You can find a good password I am keeping the password I am keeping the password Local I feel like it I will do it by y You can keep the password by no Enter Our super user is created Now the server should run Run server Migrate And run a command Now let's come here Reload it Reload Now you need a username I have kept the username Hitesh chai Login And you have logged in You have the option of view site Change password You get all this by default Change password Logout You have theming Light mode, dark mode You can keep it as you like Not only this You can also make users Go to home There are users and groups There are many more things You can make a new user Add username Confirm password Click on save You will not have a root user You can make groups We have 0 groups You can add groups And make There are many options You can change Username, email address Staff status Admin There are many things We will configure it so much That you will feel We should not have done all this In any other language That's why people use it We will see how to integrate models But the most important thing For now And the most important thing Subscribe Subscribe I hope you are having fun In Django There are many settings We have to do many configurations Because the framework is already matured It gives you superpowers This is the end of our Tailwind CSS introduction We have also taken a little Of the authentication dashboard Now we will see in the next video How we can make new models How we can perform How to take data from the database And send it to the frontend There are many things to do And we will do a lot I hope you liked it You have seen a lot of In detail documentation You have already seen a lot In 2-4 videos And often by doing this Or by making 1-2 to do apps Courses end But it depends on how many comments you make We will meet in the next video Thank you"}
