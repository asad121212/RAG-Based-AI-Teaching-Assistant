    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai and Code, our unique YouTube channel If you haven't subscribed to our channel yet, then please do it now Tell your friends to subscribe to our channel so that we can bring more interesting videos We are running a Jango series right now The rest of the videos are on a different channel This video is a part of the Jango series In the last video, we saw how Jango is set up We used UV, which is quite modern, popular and fast We saw about the file structure, how the settings are, the URL files and many more In this video, we will see how the flow structure of Jango is so that you don't face any problems in the application No matter how complex the application is, the flow of Jango is exactly the same I have made a diagram for you, we will understand it slowly After that, we will implement the diagram in the code so that we can understand the flow and structure It's a fun video, you will enjoy it I am taking the target of 300 comments, hopefully you will complete it as soon as possible Let's share the screen and discuss the diagram first Because it is a very fun diagram We will not see this diagram completely, we will see it one by one I will put it aside so that you don't face any problem Jango is a web framework All the web frameworks use a tech stack under the hood So that they can find out about the request, response, browser, etc. By default, Python can't find out which request you have, which response you have There are some event triggers that do this work behind the scenes We have a very simple flow, Jango doesn't have a thousand things It's just a simple flow, 3 or 4 things are involved in it That's it, and they are always involved That's why Jango is so reliable and fast This is your user They need a request response model That means they have a website, either they want to log in to it or see a tweet or something like that So they fired their browser and sent a request directly Now this request goes to a website Now behind the scenes, there is Nginx, Kadi, any server running on the website We don't have anything to do with it When we deploy, we will see that thing So this request goes to Jango Now what Jango does is, it finds out which resource you want to access from where you got the request Like you accessed the slash login, slash register, slash tweet, slash one, whatever the tweet ID is, you accessed it On that basis, Jango has an internal URL resolver This URL resolver doesn't do anything, it just resolves the URL Whether you want to log in or slash where you want to go You never come to this URL resolver, 99% chance that you will never see it or access it This core is inbuilt in Jango We don't see this file, nor do we have access to it by default We get it if we want, but we don't come to it This URL resolver finally accesses another file, which is called URL.py So we have this request from here The request says, resolve the URL and see where it should go Then we get the URL.py file Now this URL.py file, we saw here The way we had slash admin, we can have more resolvers of URL But it's not necessary that you always come to this URL.py, this main file Many times this URL file redirects you to another Like I told you, Jango can have multiple small apps So this URL.py can further redirect you to another URL file Consider it as a modular code, not a big deal So it's possible that you came here, it's possible that URL.py sent you directly here Now this URL.py file sends you to a file called views.py Now this views.py file is not visible anywhere But it's not that it doesn't exist, we can make it if we want So I have Jango, remember where I am, what is my level, see that Here I am in my project, this is my complete directory Project is in the directory I opened this, I will make a new file here so that we can understand it I made this views.py, it's name is views only It can't be view, it can't be my view, it can't be your view, it can't be Chai view Okay, we went to the views.py file So what does views.py file do? This is your main controller, main logic where it will be written It's possible that you have to send a response directly, welcome to Jango Or it's possible that you have to send via models.py We don't have the models file now, it will eventually come Through this, we can contact DB Or your views.py file can also contact DB It has a complete option, we have ORMs in Jango, we will discuss them too But now the main thing is that the views.py file has the access to take something from the database To save something in it, all our logic is written here Once you have written the logic, then you have to send a response to the front end And this response comes straight to Jango And Jango sends this response, that's it And sometimes it uses some templates, which we will do too And via template it sends you the response So this is a complete complex architecture that is behind the scenes in Jango Now if I want to make a small architecture of this How will we do this, it's very easy You have a user, this is our user This user sent a request, so suppose we got a request Now where will this request go, it will go to the urls.py file Who will the urls.py file call, it will call the views That's it, so let's make arrows on it The user sent a request, the request went to our url.py And the url.py sent it to the views What will the views do, it will send a response to the url So it came back to the url We will not accept the url, it will send you a response So we will send it here and take a simple response Here, the response is sent to you, that's it And this is your complete Jango That's it, in 4 lines, our Jango is complete You get a request, the request hits the urls.py The urls.py can call the views Views are different ways of how it will send you a response It may send a query from the database, it may send a direct response It may send through templates, it may send through something else This is your complete logical structure So if you ever want to understand Jango, if you understand this That's it, nothing else to do This is all the work of Jango And if you want to understand in more detail, then this is the complete structure You may have made a diagram in which you are taking your notes So this is our work Now let's follow this diagram First, we go to this views.py Because here we will write our logic So we write logic, how will we work After that we will go to urls.py Which view to hit on which url And then we will see the request response It's a very basic work So let's go to the code one So we have views.py on the code Look carefully, this is the level of views.py This level has a lot of problems The name is views.py If there is some other name, then the problem comes It's a framework, the name is restricted in the framework Okay, so you understood this Now let's go to write some code So let's write the code It's a very basic python code Hope you know python If you don't know, then you will understand a lot Many people learn python on the go So maybe this is the same phase for you So first of all, we have to take django.http Where will it come from? Import will come from http response There is also a request Now we are not on request, now we just have to give response So we got this, now you can give response As soon as you get http request or response Means you are ready to take both request and response Compared to if you are coming from any other programming language Then you have to take request, response, etc. In python, you don't have to do this Now we have to make some methods or you can say function So my first function is home You have to add request here So that you know that I have to return this home on a request And after that I said return Now what do you have to return? I have to return http response What kind of response do you have to return? Let's do one thing for now We say directly that you do a small response Which is hello world And let's say this You are at chai or django homepage Now what will I do with this line? I will copy it here because I am going to create 2-3 more responses Or I will copy and paste this whole thing That will also be fine So this is what you have Now what will you have to do in this way? In this way, you can make more routes if you want We take 2 more Let's add a gap between them So take this This route will be about The name of these methods can be anything In that case, you don't have a restriction You call it about, you call it chai about, call it superman Nobody is stopping you Yes, you can also say nagraj There is no such load in it We go to the second and write another contact page Now what do we do? Let's change it a little This is django's about page And this is our contact page Okay Now one thing is done Whatever I had to write in views I have written it now I don't have to do anything more than this Further, we do not need to export anything in python And all that is not needed So I have done a very basic job Now let's go next What do you want to do next? Next you have to handle URLs Okay So URLs are not such a big thing You can handle it easily So these are our URLs We have also given some comments here And we also get some examples That you took admin from django Admin was used here Okay Path has been used As such, no path is being used now But we still keep it Now when you have to use views Because the URL will come Then I don't know which one to hit So you have to tell in the URL Whether you want to hit the about method Or home method It is very basic So what we do here We write a path So here is our path Which path will be? Our path will be home route You write home route like this We don't do this in python Or in django specially Now we need views But we don't have views So let's import first From our current directory You import views Here are the views Now which one on this route You have to add So I have to add views Dot And you have access to different routes Home Along with this We also pass an optional parameter Which will help you a lot in the future That is name That of this entire route Or this entire method What name do you want to give I want to give its name home This last line If you don't even write Then you will not get any error But its use case We will see after a while How it comes in use That's it That's all Your URL handle is done Now you know If you want to handle about How will you do So here This is done Let's call it about And further here Let's also bring it about method And path Path is about So as above Admin is written Here is about and slash It is important to write slash Leaving home route After that Here you have contact Contact And here view b Contact Oops Contact Did we write contact there? Contact And its name will be Contact So we have this We forgot to put comma So there is no big problem Let's also put this So this is done Now we have route So this way You have routing And your homepage is done That's it That's all Now let's see How we have the matter We open our terminal here And how to run So if you know Last time we saw python And here you can do it straight Manage.py Now see carefully I am hitting tab But I am not getting manage file Why not? Because as soon as I do ls I don't have that file I have to go to that folder This is a very common mistake Please don't do it See if you have access to manage.py file Or not So we go here In Chai and Django I did ls Now I have manage.py file Who has command access Run server So we come here python And through manage.py file We call it run server As you say run server You know We will see about in migration and errors later There are no errors There is only warning For now we come to this route And access Okay You go to this url So see we reached very easily Hello world You are at Chai and Django homepage Can you see? Okay Zoom is also a little So we will do a little You must be seeing a little Okay There is a lot of 400% zoom But at least it is visible Now further If I have to go on this route So I can go on more routes like this Suppose We go here Slash About So we went to slash about So Hmm Slash about Let's copy Let me change the url please Slash about Yes So we came to the about page And in the same way And in the same way You know that you can also go to contact So we went to contact So all three of our pages are being rendered Although not so good renders But at least our work is done So we come to this diagram So see Made the same views Enter urls And sent the response That's it That's all the work So I think now you must have understood That okay Django was hit with us Url was resolved It hit urls.py Further we did not have any url.py So we got from there Which view to load View has not taken any access to model.py Because it did not have it It has to send the response from there Response is always sent by views Views sent the response No template was used Sent the response straight So for now the matter is fine There is no such bad thing That yes Whatever we wanted to do That was working with us Now what is the story of these templates See Django's templates Are one of the most powerful templates Through which work is done Which you see in next.js That you have layout files Or such files So in Django Templating system is very good And we will discuss more on their templates What are these templates How are they used Used extensively So let's use the templates How can we do it a little So see for templates First we close all these files Okay Now where to make templates See where to make templates It will depend on How are you looking at the files And what have you set This setting can be changed completely As such it is not a big deal So first of all follow See where I am now See this carefully I am on manage.py file And This chai and django Internal folder is here So first of all I am right clicking on my root folder And I am making a new folder The name of the folder is templates Apply s You can also change it I will tell you that too But for now we are keeping templates here Because we are creating files here So we make another file or folder here We name it Oops I don't want to go inside This happens many times I have to make a new folder on this And I name it static Okay Now in static Our CSS and JavaScript will go And our templates Our html files will go there These are completely changed When you learn to make further sub apps I will discuss it again Don't worry too much now It is very easy We have made a new file in templates We named it You can name the file as you like It is not necessary to keep the index You can keep superman if you want This is our html So here is the basic html We go here And I wrote it chai and django And we come here further Let's take a simple h1 And write chai and django in it Everyone knows how to write this html We are not worrying about CSS now We just need a basic one So that chai and django will be written That's it Now what I have to do I want to load this template And return it Okay So what you have to do First come here And views will do this Till now you were sending Http response Now what I have to do I have to render a template It is a technical jargon term Render means sending the html page So for that we have to take Django's help And there are some shortcuts in Django These shortcuts are very powerful You will use it in many places We import this from where From render So from Django shortcuts We have to import one thing Which is called render Now render has come to you So you can do this return Comment We don't need you You are something special We want to return something else So here while returning What can you do Return it using render So here what do you want to render You will get a request So you have to take the request So take the request Plus what I want to do I want to return a template Which is called index.html Now surprisingly You should have a thought That how does Django know Internally that I have kept it in templates I have to return the index file So some magic is happening behind the scenes Of course it is happening A lot of magic is happening But without modifying any settings We have to modify We have to load index.html from here Templates Is this written in Django pre-default Yes, it is written mostly But now we face some errors Exploratory is our learning So we explore How things can be done from where Let's see what errors come Let's go to the homepage How do we go here So we have I think Here it is Contact page is being served correctly There is no problem in it Hopefully it should not be So contact page It is running correctly The problem we should face Should come on this homepage On the homepage Now it has zoomed a little more Let's reduce it a little So it said that the template does not exist Index.html It is true that the template does not exist But see how many good errors you get Because we have written debugging true So you know completely From where, what is the response What kind of Very good logs Very good settings You get everything here Now let's go Why this template did not load Because if we load directly Then we will never face this error If you never face this error in life Then how will you know Yes, these errors can also come The more errors you see The better the work will be Okay, now let's go To resolve this error See you wrote the template Wrote everything There was no mistake in it Everything was right But what did you do Everything is written correctly But the main project Forgot to tell him From where to load templates So we will go to its settings.py file Here you do not have to understand the entire file It is not necessary to understand at once We understand slowly Now go down a little here You will get a section Where it will be written templates And the template's error will be there And here jango templates Directories, app directories All this will be written What we will do Will tell Which jango templates Are found in which directories Defaults are also there But you have to mention manually What am I doing for now I am writing only in single quotes Templates Yes So take this Take this White color is done And apart from this We also take an h1 And whenever h1 will be there In it we will center the text align And also make it a little bigger Our font size How much to take Take 2m Okay, let's take 2m I am not interested in writing more css I know you too No special interest Because eventually we will learn How can you load tailwind Or you can upload more styling So as such There is no problem Now our matter comes If css has come here How can it be loaded So you go straight In your template In the index And tell it You load it Okay We come here Link Colon css And take this But the thing is All this is fine How do I give a reference of style Because directly I will go up one folder Will it work Let's see That we told this file Do one thing Go to one directory back Go to one directory back again And there you will get a static file And you will get style.css Hmm Will it work Let's see Reload Hmm It is not working here Some errors came Errors are also there That static style.css Was tried to get But actually I did not get anything So this approach is not working This thing is 100% decided So here A special syntax comes A structure comes Which is called Templating engine And what is that templating engine You don't have to do anything special In Django This html file only Works as a template engine Template engine means That you can inject anywhere Your programmatically code This was a very common technique You must have seen Index.php file used to be there In the early days And you put a question mark like this And By doing php and all And you could load some part of php The same thing happens in Django That if you want to add code Or inject some data from views Then you inject the template Or inject the code So what we will do In this href We will inject How is it injected You need curly braces And two percentage signs It is not always constant Some things change But mostly you will see this Curly braces and percentage After this there are some keywords Like one keyword is static This static keyword tells That I am loading some static asset Which static asset? The same That I have a file Which is called style.css Load that Ok, this is also correct That you understood Now we come to Actually, will this work or not Or how will it work We still have two mistakes in this But we will not see now We will see as soon as the errors come See, telling you directly Then it is not fun to learn Because I told you a straight sequence Always follow this See those errors Because of which you will become An actual programmer It is fun in this series First tell me this That when we take such a good explanation In full detail Then so much fun Comes in the live class But ok, hope you are having fun here too Let's see this We loaded Now there is more problem That what is this invalid block Static Did you forget to register the load this tag Or something like this So we will see Yes So actually what is this This line Look at it carefully What is this? Do I have to load something too Yes, absolutely Whenever you use any static asset Or static keyword So the template engine has to be told first That you have to load static assets So always Before the top of the file Even before the doc What do you do Take curly braces Take percentages And tell it that I will load static assets So we will load static Here we loaded static This is also a templating engine again Ok, this is also loaded Now let's come to reload Now we have chai and django That error is over But still my CSS file Is not being implemented Ok We come here So if you see What do you have It is visible at the bottom Get static style.css So we come here Right click And see what is in the page source Now see in the page source The style sheet I have Is loading Where is it loading And how is it loading The style sheet you have Is loading Slash static Slash style.css Hmm In static style.css But there is no file here Either bring the whole path Or bring it from dot slash Because the whole path Or whatever your localhost Whatever your directory Or whatever your localhost name is Bring the whole file How will you be able to access In this way Because you are not able to access Because this path does not exist This whole path should be accessible Only then we can come here Ok So now we go back Ok, we have come to chai and django And we will read about A final setting And where are the settings You know It is always in the same file In settings.py Now how can we Do the settings here See what is the problem The problem is You have scrolled once Not more You have scrolled once Go down more Here you will get Static URL That static URL Always starts like this But to start the static URL You have to tell some Static directories That my static asset Is kept there And whenever you load it Load it from a complete path So what we will do First of all Go to the top of the file And a by default library You have available Which is OS What will happen with this OS library See you have A base directory Always Which tells you the path How things will be resolved Or what is the path Of my entire application If you will ever deploy Then also you will not have To make much changes Because the base directory Resolves by itself From the parent This is the best Benefit of Django That your development Is very close to your production So what we will do We will give a new setting Here Scroll and come Where there is a static URL Now according to The production practices You should write this Here But many times We have seen That the static URL Is kept here And the static URL Is kept here So what we will do We have learned From somewhere Or seen from somewhere You add this At the end of the line No, you should not do this It does not give any effect But when someone Is looking at your code Then he expects That some settings Will be at a particular place So it is expected Here Now here we have A new setting Which we will add Which is Static files Write this carefully Underscore D-I-R-S So this I also have to see Many times It is not that I also remember Many times I remember Many times In Django documentation I go and see That was it files or files Was it dir or dir After making 2-4 projects I remember But many times When you are working In JS a lot And you go back here So let's see It is not a bad thing Now how to load this To load this First of all Give square brackets Like this And after that I will say What you do Use OS And there is a path Which you have to join Okay Path.join What all do you have to join One thing You have a base directory Which is already defined above Along with that You add this static So you are static Now what will happen Now your whole Base directory Whole file It knows From where to load Static assets And whenever it is loaded We have to give the path Of the whole file Once I gave this access Now let's go here And reload Now our CSS Is injected here Now whether it is CSS Or JavaScript You know all the flow How can we inject it So let's come here Now in case If you assume Static JavaScript Is loaded Or you want to make Further folder in it Then you know How can I work And how I have to Bring changes in the index I have static I have loaded it And now load Style.css from here Or load from CSS Or load JavaScript We can also load that So at least Now you know Everything from The whole templating engine And this too You know most importantly That where Which error comes You are not Resolving the errors With your eyes closed You know That loading Is a very difficult thing And you know That you have to Read load static Oh! Maybe I forgot To load static You gave the solution Of that thing Not by closing your eyes And doing settings No no Exactly what is the problem What is the reason behind it And how can I Resolve it When you understand this Then you become a good programmer Okay I hope You understood Django And how rapidly Okay Take a small assignment How will you go like this So now we saw That we have Django's template Is loaded Of index.html So make this index file A little more And make a basic html You can do this much Core.css You can write this much So now A small assignment for you Is that The views we have made This about And this contact Till now We are sending HTTP response Now it is your responsibility That instead of sending response You render some webpages There Which webpages Are totally on you But yes Do tell me By tweeting Or On insta Or Wherever you are On LinkedIn That what kind of Homepage have you made What kind of About us page have you made What kind of Contact page About page have you made So this is your assignment Do the assignment When you do this assignment When you write comments You show your engagement Your dedication That yes I am not just watching The video Sitting on the sofa I am also working With it We learn from this Otherwise You will get stuck In tutorial hell Tutorial hell does not mean That don't watch the video Tutorial hell means That watch it And work with it Do assignments Okay See you in the next video"
