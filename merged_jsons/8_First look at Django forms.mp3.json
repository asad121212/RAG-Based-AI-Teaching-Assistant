    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai Aur Code Our unique YouTube channel which is moving forward very fast And many people are liking it in India How is the production level content? We should show professionalism And focus more on content This is what you all like Thank you so much, so we are doing this In this video also we will take our Django series ahead And will give you a little introduction about forms Django's forms are very powerful And you will enjoy watching a small connection with these forms This video is not a complete in-depth guide of forms We will discuss that in another video Now you just have to give a glimpse This video should have been the last part of the video But then we saw that the video has become too long So we will break it into two parts By the way, you will get the complete documentation in the description You can see it and all the links will be there So let's start with this The target of this video is not much, 250 comments So get it completed quickly If you haven't subscribed yet, then do it And we move towards our forms Forms are very interesting in Django And forms are actually a study material in Django Like the admin panel is a study material But at least you will get a first introduction Then you will understand the wiring How the entire wiring of forms is in Django framework Because it is a little difficult to understand It is not that easy Because a new element is added to the forms Till now we have seen that models are added Views are added After that we added templates This was our forms One more element is introduced And how that element will be introduced Depends on how you have done the modeling of your data Let me tell you how Now we are here Our VS code Which is running on the tea theme Tea theme looks good This is our situation This is our database We have seen that we have tea varieties We have seen admin panel injection How inline admin panel injections are By injection I mean How we have added a new field Which will be visible only in one existing model There are certificates and stores We have seen this too So this was our basic Now my goal is That all this is visible I want to add a new layout And update all its URLs It is very easy I think you can do this We are doing this first Because it is not easy to make a connection Because it can be a little complex That's why I have kept it separate Please follow the guide Otherwise you will get stuck in the confusion of Django So we open our tea You know how to add a new template Open the template You can add a file in tea Whatever you want I think we will keep the file name as tea stores So we are here And then we add the extension Layout.html And then we add a block Unnamed block content We keep the name as content And then we add the extension Test content for forms We will make forms here But have the forms come yet? Not yet And it is not like this So we will make it soon We will make it soon And then we will add the extension It has not come yet And it can not come like this So what to do to bring the forms You know this much You have to add a view You have to add only one view So we keep the name of this view Tea store view View Here it is You know the basics You will take the request here We don't need any parameter You can return here We have to return render And here I will give the request Take it And which template you want to return So I will give in tea Slash If this string is not there then suggestions come But ok And we don't have to give anything else We don't have to pass objects Ok What to do now You know that this wiring will not work so easily For this, you have to add a URL This is basic 101 Till now everyone knows So we duplicate it And we say where we have to show it We will do it on tea underscore store We also bring the view Our name of the view is What is our name Tea store view Ok Tea underscore store view I will keep the name of this Tea store Tea store Tea store You can see So I think now we have If there is no problem Then tea store should be there Let's see if there is any bug We will fix it Now we have test content For forms Till now there was no big problem We have seen these things before In fact, we have seen that if we have to bring data If we have to take some model We need a unique URL If we have to query on the basis of URL Or we need complete data Now we want to go to the next level Now see what is the goal The goal is that when I come to this form What did I get here I got a drop down Where all the tea varieties are available And as soon as I select the tea variety On that basis, you tell me Which store is available So to do this First let's go to the admin panel So the first thing To find the tea variety You have to go to tea varieties So that you can take all the fields Now when you can take all the fields Then here we have a drop down Which makes sense that from here We can take all the names Which type you have You can take that type If you want, you can also take the name This is also fine So one thing is decided that tea variety Is the only model that can work for me But based on which tea is the name If I want to know the store Then I will have to put a query in the store That only give the store Who has that specific tea available So I have to interact with two models Okay Now what we will do First of all, let me tell you a little interesting thing We will make a new file Which will give you a little problem to understand But eventually you will understand There is no such problem The name of this file is forms.py And this is an additional layer Because all the files we have seen We have not seen this file called form Where did this form come from This form is very interesting About this We will know about it in the coming videos How does it actually work So if you look at Django forms Then it is a Sometimes it becomes a whole course And you will see Django forms On documentation So you have a lot of forms Which automatically link with many models You get get post values You can see a lot of documentation You will go to any segment There are widgets, views, form classes How many forms are there in it Care fields You can take data on character basis There is a lot of work We will choose only one of them And we will see a little flow in this video Just that the flow is understood After that, we will come to the inner details So what will have to do to get forms First of all, we come and say Django please give forms So I need import Here it is Django has given forms Now with which forms We will have to attach a model Otherwise, where will the form data come from Who will attach it on the basis of So we need a model So we import the tea variety Because it makes sense What will I do with the direct store Now I have taken this here Now a class is always made in forms It is given in the documentation We are going to do the same You can also take it on the basis of method But we will go a little on this format Class name form Whatever form you are taking And after that your name care field We will do all this in the same way It may seem a little uneven at once But eventually the same pattern repeats So we take it Tea variety form Whatever you have to give the name of the form Tea variety form We take a dot capital form from the form above As we were told in the documentation That you have to come this way And take it this way Now When so much work is done We make a variable called tea variety We call it tea underscore Variety Now how will tea variety come Every form is linked on the basis of model You can put a label in the character field Max field If you just Take data from the user And just save it Then you have a lot of options But if your model is made If you want to display that model In the existing form Then we have many such forms Which can be auto linked One of these forms Model choice field What does it do In your existing form You can query in the existing model And you can give it Query set parameter In the query set You do one thing Take everything out of the model Objects dot all Now this is very intelligent It will not take out everything Because you have said choice field So I don't have to do much work It will give the choice field In the form, the choice field is drop down So I don't need to make a drop down It will make a drop down by itself I have told it It will make a box Where I have to input characters And if you want you can give a label on it Label does not do much work Just to tell the user What is this form for So I told it to select Chai variety Now we do this much on this form We will not write much code on the form Otherwise confusion will be created So it is okay Wrote a code of one line Give me a special type of choice field And attach it with chai variety With objects So far the story is right Now we come to our views Till now what was the view doing It was rendering a form It was rendering an HTML page There is no problem in this Now we have two cases One case is I just have to show you the form One case is when you submit the form Both cases are usually Handled together Usually first of all If you are submitting the form What we will do First of all I make a variable Stores Initialize it Why make a store Because when you submit the form I will pass this variable on the front end Here we will pass a comma Let's do it now Here we have stores And not like this Here we have stores And here we have stores Now by passing this Whatever I will run a query filter Whatever comes from the name of variety Based on that Filter and give stores I will put a loop on it This is the work of stores First of all detect That the request you have Is it a post request or not For this it is very easy I can find in request.method Post method or get method Based on this I can run selective code If you have a post Then you must have a form If form has come Then from where it came First of all import the form Because if you are using form Then form must have come from somewhere So what we do From.forms Import and import the whole class ChaiVarietyForm Here Now whatever is written in form I can import it And use it here First of all make a variable And say The form I have imported Bring it from here And pass it as it is Request.post Now by passing Request.post Whatever data was traveling in post That has come to you In this form variable Now our use case says That you are taking only one value in this form But it is possible that in the future There are two values, three values, four values So whatever values will be there All of them will come to you Now Django knows that Directly processing this form variable Is a little problematic So we will process the form only when it is a valid form Valid means Django will see that you have taken a character field So characters are coming in it If you take a drop down Then value is selected from the drop down So Django gives you some methods Which you can use Like one method is underscore valid This should have come in the suggestion But it is not coming Now you have This value Now how to check it So further you have You can make variables Take this form from this form Now another method This is a very common method Common knowledge You want clean data From which field We will call the field Chai underscore variety Now you will say This name is to be given on the front end No no no This name is coming from here Let's copy it Because you have made the form of this name So the model choice field will be visible on the front end So you are defining the fields here The name of this field Will be the same in this post Ok variety But whatever it is You know the linking Now what can I do Chai underscore Take this I have put chai variety Now what is inside chai variety That particular value You have the form You have checked the validation Now from this particular multiple fields We need one field Chai variety Which we will get Now come to views You have got the data Everything is done Now end of the day What was the problem statement Give only the chai where chai variety is available So what we do First we need store So along with chai variety We also bring store So we come here And tell it The store which we have Let's take objects on it And Last time we put all Now we put filter You can pass the query We will pass the query That we have chai variety available Let's check this chai variety in the model So that we don't do anything wrong Because typos happen So we go to model Chai variety Is available here Let's check this We want to pass filter And filter We will take chai varieties So for once we pass filter Chai varieties And we will pass this We come back to this What we need We need the object We have to put the filtration Let's check this Store So this chai varieties We copy it Because we are putting filter on it So this thing We are putting filter And what is my value I am taking that value from chai variety Here expected indented block You wanted block You wanted block You should have been indent Ok I understood this Let's store all the variables So stores And we have stored it Now I have the value of stores Now you know why we have stored stores One interesting thing Which you don't know Which we have to send together That is form Validation of form is checked here But if there is a request method Form or anything Or anything is happening You have made a chai variety form There You have to send this form Whenever you are using this kind of forms There is no exception in this So what we will do We will send form What will happen by sending this form Now by sending this form We have no effect on it Because we have no changes in the template Ok Local variable form Where it is associated with the value Ok Here it is not getting values We will give values Till now you have understood Now we will handle this problem one by one What is coming Now we have Form is not associated with a value Ok I think we will check once We have declared form But form is inside if block It is very easy You can declare it outside We have to give one more solution Because if you remember I told you two three cases One when this form is being rendered One when you are submitting form If your form is being submitted If form is not being submitted Then also by default we have to show form We missed that case That is our else case Whenever you will deal with form You will have these two three cases We will build form with our chai variety form Take this Multiple fields can be there in form In our case We have only one field Ok Now hopefully it should be fine Now I will give a summary again There are three cases of form First case is You want to render Here we have not passed any form Now one form is in default state When user fill form And send it So first handle is We have filled form and sent it This is what we handled here One case is just to make form and send it to user So that user can fill data in it From drop down or fill name You fill form from here Actually you make form from here Because form is coming from form file So we made form from chai variety form Now we have only one field We can have more fields So now I think you understood this much This is major Now we will go to chai variety stores Now we will show you special magic of django We made a form In which we don't need any action Important for me is Method Here is method and method I have given post Now you don't have to do anything Just inject and write form As soon as you write form Now I go here you see values In drop down you have Small ginger tea, large masala tea, medium masala tea Everything Now this is why you are getting in drop down Especially in name field Because you have told In forms Take me from all objects It is taking automatically And we have defined it as it is This model choice field All these stories If you suppose here I duplicate it for a minute And I do this comment So if you want You can also take care field Remove it And we say give me care field Simply Here we did save And now we have character field Because here you can give character values So depends on django Django tries to think of many things And brings values there And what value you are selecting from forms What you want to show Everything will depend on it Now here you will see many things in django The form class, the view Which fields you can see here So email field Boolean field There are many selections In this exactly what value you want to take Or what to show from database That depends So now what we do Remove it So that django actually has a form So we refreshed and saw That we have all the values Now as soon as I suppose selected So here Small ginger tea I think should be selected Ok, it will be selected But not yet because we have not finished the whole work on the template See Now what is in django It needs a submit button So let's make a button here We put this button Search store And django needs a submit And this is also our type Which is Submit Submit Ok So search store is ok But ok, work is going on So now you can't send it Why can't you send it Because you have not rendered the form properly That is a little issue of CSS But after forms you get more options Like after forms you put a dot here So you have one option As underscore p Yes, this is a very interesting option Because it is rendering better and sometimes better Ok, still a problem will come If you search store it You will get an error CSRF verification failed By default django Proves every form That you could not do any injection And could not hit vulnerability So whenever you use a form with django You always have to give a CSRF token You don't have to manually Inject this token Django does it for you Whenever you make a form You have to give it You don't have any special option So now I refresh it Cancel So we go to Chai stores Now select small ginger tea And send it Oops, still issues Our form is not submitting properly Let's see Now another variable Let's worry about it Another variable Stores I know that stores is a simple array I can loop it If there is a store I will do a conditional rendering So we go to django if If Paste Ok, no suggestion So here Block If Will I get a suggestion No So let's go to classic Ok First block if If we have stores If there are stores Then on that basis We will do a conditional rendering Before I forget End if This is the most boring thing In templating engine You have to do end if and end blocks Now this is done Now we take h2 What is h2 Stores Available We save it Stores available Because you have that variable After coming here we do a simple loop To define an unordered list In all the stores So what to do Take an unordered list Go to it For Unnamed Block And in this block Remove it First we Take a loop here for Store In Stores And here enter Enter And here we do it End For If we get some more suggestions then it would be good And here we can do Take a simple li And here we inject values Whatever our value will be Store.name And location Keep it Only two things Store.location So hopefully Now as you are selecting You should get values Large masala tea And medium masala tea So it is searching But actually it is white So here it is Having some problem I will do one thing It is CSS issues We take one more here CD, Chai or Django And python Manage.py Tailwind start I think tailwind should Make things better Continue So we go with tailwind Because the issues Are coming only for visibility Form For this whole content I have to Make color white So let me see How to make it black I am not focusing on CSS Because it takes time But I have kept a class on a simple form What should I do Make the text black So what happened The text is black But the text of select chai and search store Is also black So medium chai As you submit large masala tea You get it on jaypur store Ginger tea And medium Delhi For peace of mind We will go to admin panel And make a store So that we get to know more values So we make a store And go to Mumbai Mumbai And here Mumbai store And here we will keep only a large tea So select large tea And Mumbai should come And add it Congratulations Now we know If I select large So let's come here Select large masala tea And search store And see now we have jaypur And Mumbai location So I think you got to know How stores work I will give you a small summary Because our focus Is not on UI When we make a project Now we understand the flow How it flows To make a form You make a form And these are the fields Now we have a tea field But there can be multiple fields So when you get the form You associate it directly With all the tea objects You can also associate it with multiple values But when you do it You associate it with the value But jango is not that intelligent We want to force jango I will talk about this in detail In the next video Now I know How I have a field Whether it is a model choice field Or a character field After that I have to take this form To views When you handle forms in views You have to see two cases First case You have a basic form Which you took from there And passed it So all the fields in the tea field You have to pass it And pass it on the view Another case When the user has submitted the form What to do First you detect Post method, get method Which method we have to work on We handle all that Once this work is done We have to put queries We have put a basic query But you can fetch the data We have passed it This data passing Has nothing to do with form This is a basic variable We have shown the loop So in this section We have not talked about form Only this One more thing You can render the form in different ways You can render it as a paragraph Important thing is You have to pass CSRF token How does CSRF token look Let's see When you right click And go to inspect You will see Form Let's bring it to the side And bring it To the right side You will see all your forms You will see an input type Hidden This is a middleware token It automatically injects middleware And the more you see the form The more you will see the change in the value Every time when the form is reloaded A unique value is generated Which saves us from CSRF attack That the form we submitted Has come from our front end And is going to our back end This is a small injection It is a good thing We have a label, select, require field HIRIT This is an interesting talk I think This video has given you Some knowledge enhancement You will get the documentation Forms are a bit complex In Django It is not that easy to handle There are many courses for forms But I think you have got enough knowledge As we will do more projects Subscribe for more videos See you in the next video"
