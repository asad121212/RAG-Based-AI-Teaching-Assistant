there Code files are available for you I have already uploaded everything on Chaicode.com So you can take all the code files from there And everything is available for you Now let's talk about what we are going to do in this video This video will give you complete confidence How I can build a customised application in Django We won't focus too much on UI You can use Tailwind if you want Which I have already taught You can use Bootstrap Material if you want Our goal in this video is To see the complete flow of Django In one project How Django projects are created How Django apps are created And how Django models are designed Then we will see forms are designed Views are designed Those views are locked So that only the logged in user can see some views We will learn to keep some views open publicly Not only that, we will see How to make Django We can build forms only by using Django and Django's forms One of the super power of Django is built in forms Not only that, we will see How to perform custom user registration, custom user login and custom user logout After seeing custom user login performance and registration You will feel that all these things are inbuilt and can be modified And you can also create existing ones One of the goal of this project is To give you confidence and know the flow of Django In these frameworks, the most important thing is To know the flow and architecture Where and what is there Because of which error Which thing is causing us problem and how to fix it We have not removed any errors We will do debugging together We will see together that which error is coming and how to resolve it Which is an essential part of programming And in the same way, we will build a complete application With customized user registration, customized login, customized logout And other than that, customized form creation Regular Django form creation Models, forms, views, urls And customized settings, static images upload We will see a lot of things You will like it a lot, it will be fun And if you are enjoying it, then please click a selfie I feel very good when you are reading on this channel And upload a selfie on Twitter, LinkedIn or anywhere So it feels good to know that you are reading Tell us in the comments which states, which countries, which cities are you watching It feels good to know that everyone is reading So that's it, we have talked a lot Now let's start with the next segment How are we going to do it We will set up from scratch So in case if you have not seen the old videos Then also there is no problem You can also start from here easily So let's start with the next segment Our mega project of Django And thank you so much, this is the final video of this series Yes, how are you all Welcome to Chai Aur Code Our unique YouTube channel Which you have given a lot of love Thank you so much for that and subscribe too And let's start our Django mega project Whenever you are watching the video, you are watching it in one shot In this section we will discuss How are we going to build the project Or what is the future goal What are we going to build Okay, let me tell you one more small thing I had commented and messaged Will you cover Django REST framework in this See, you have the right to ask It is my duty to explain that too See, Django and Django REST framework Are two completely different things Like React and Next.js We cannot mix these two Like there was a separate playlist on the channel React came separately, Next.js came separately Some people said mix Next.js in React Or read React in Next This does not happen If you want to read and learn professionally So keeping things separate is also a task Which I have to do So just for clarity Django is a different thing Django REST framework is a different thing Like this Flask is different, FastAPI is different So if things are separate Then it is right and also beneficial to learn Django REST framework is useful through Django But this is like Next.js comes through React But it should not be done REST framework, REST API Is more centric, more focused Django framework is complete For making full applications For templating engine And its use case is there So we will not cover Django REST framework in this playlist There will be a separate playlist for that If it comes, whenever it comes So please understand the difference And explaining is my duty Like asking is your duty So I hope this is clear to you Now I will walk you through in this segment In this portion, in this video We will make a project What is our goal There are so many nit gritties in Django Because it is an old framework Well established, well stable So there are so many things in it You will see that Experts have worked for 2-3 years They also keep exploring Is this also possible In Django or any framework The best thing is to build more and more And learn more things on the go We are going to do the same If there is a new requirement in the project Then learn new topics It does not make much sense to pick them and learn So what we will see in this project It covers all of your full stack With authentication Django forms everything is covered So I think you will find a lot of interest And it will be a lot of fun Let me give you a small walkthrough What we are going to build in this Let's share the screen in front of you So in this way we will build our project here This is a small different twitter style application Where we have Login and register button We also have tweets One is tweeted by Pankaj One is tweeted by Hitesh This is Pankaj's tweet This is another tweet for cricket Now you will see that you have a create tweet button Obviously we are taking images And we are also taking text This is the most important thing You can take images, you can take text You can manipulate the text As soon as you do create tweet You are not allowed to tweet Because you are not a logged in user But you can see that you are allowed to read tweets So we will see that selectively Which routes can be authenticated Some routes or some views We can make publicly available So both our context is covered here Now let's create tweet There is no account, so let's go to the register account first This is the whole registration form I have not built it, we are using the power of Django forms In fact, I have not written a line I have written all the html auto generated I have written a little bit, but mostly auto generated Now let's take the username Suppose we take the new user Shubham Let's take Shubham's email Shubham at the rate gmail.com And password I am keeping the same password 12345 So that I remember what is kept here 12345 By the way, we have used all the forms of Django And all the forms and manipulations Like your password can be too similar These are all the default security mechanisms of Django Like suppose if I miss a few letters here And try to register So the password to match the field You can also give them Authentication Conditionally red colors or all that It is a very basic thing, there is nothing in it But you can see that our forms have also been auto filled Have also been removed, you can write again If the email is not correct in this way So now Django is checking itself We are not doing anything, we are using Django's super power Let's register Oops Wrong Hopefully it is right this time Okay So we register And it is registered After registering, the flow we made We have also logged it directly You can remove it if you want, we will discuss that flow Obviously After logging in, you will see that I can create a tweet So this is a text box, we are using Django again No customized form has been made You can manipulate it, you can redesign it There are many ways to make the forms Better You can also write classes there We have not written it, we wanted to do it directly in the basic flow In the coming future projects Obviously we will craft it more As the projects will come They will come So this is another Tweet To subscribe Subscribe Chai or Code YouTube Channel Let's choose a photo I think This photo has been used Let's use this And let's submit This is our tweet Now you will see I have done this tweet So I can see edit and delete buttons You can make more beautiful buttons But I can edit it Hope Hope you will Enjoy The content We have submitted it Our tweet has been edited There are restrictions in the tweet You can delete it Let's delete it Delete this tweet Let's choose a photo Let's choose a photo Let's submit You can delete it We have deleted it We have reached the confirmation page You can go back We have deleted it You can log out As soon as you log out The buttons are gone And you are not allowed to Create tweets You can log in Log out Register It is a very Basic project But it will teach you Many details I think Because it's not just about foundation basics, the goal is to use that foundation to implement something. Once you can build this much basics, then you will do some CSS changes, read about some more forms, read about some more registration, read about users. Apart from this, we also have our admin here. I think I created admin. Let me see. There is also an admin where we have fully controlled. So yes, we have admin here. We have admin dashboard, full tweets. Shubham's tweets, Pankaj's, you can manipulate any tweets. All users are associated here. You can see the list of all users, who have signed up, the roles you have to access, you have to give some more information. So we have the complete configuration available in Django. We will see how it is done. So in total, it's a very good project, a very in-depth project. I hope you are excited about this project because this is our first foundation project. After this, as more projects come, we will increase the complexity. But this will be our final project for this series. At least we can say goodbye to this series with a decent project. As we move forward, the complexity will obviously increase. So subscribe and let's meet in the next video, in the next segment for you. Where we start this project and a lot of revision will be done. Making projects, setting files, URLs, a lot of revision will be done. Okay, let's meet. So let's continue our Django series. And in this segment, we will do project setup. Project setup is going to be very fast. Because last time when we were doing project setup, app setup, we were learning. So that flow was slow. Now it will be fast. So let's tell you how to get help for documentation. Here we have documentation. Everyone knows that documentation is available on docs.shyco.com. And there is no need to read the whole documentation. As we will see what exactly we need, we will work accordingly. Now I know that I have made a folder here called Django Final. I have to create a project in it. But I don't want to create a direct project. I want to create a virtual environment. Now it is obvious that who remembers how to make a virtual environment. So let's go to docs and see how it will be made. Getting Started with Django. So from this line, our virtual environment will be created. Copy it. And here it is. Our virtual environment is created. Now I think you must remember how to enable virtual environment. I remember. Source. And then I can go to .venv. In bin. And in activate. So now my virtual environment is activated. If you don't remember, then there is no problem. Go here and copy and paste. It's simple. Now you have to install Django. We don't have to do all this. I told you that it is optional. If you want to do it, then do it. We need pip install django. We have to do this. Let's do pip install django. So let's come here. And pip install django. Alright. Hopefully it should be fast. Here we have django. If you want to upgrade, you can do it. Let's do the upgrade. Copy and paste. And pip will be upgraded. One common thing you will see is that pip is freezed. As soon as you make a project and make its requirements, a command like this works. pip freeze. And then we put it in the requirements. requirements.txt Simple txt file. Whatever you are installing in this, it is also in the requirements file. Their package.json is in a way. Whatever you install, it is in the project at the end. As soon as the project is finished, it is installed in the requirements. Means push it. What happens with this is that you will see a command here. If you want to install from a file, then pip install. Give the file name by putting dash r. Whatever the dependencies of that package are, Like obviously we are going to use images. So the pillow and everything will come. So all that work is done by it. How to start django project? django admin start project. And whatever you want to name the project. We also do it here. django admin start project. And we name this project. Chai center. Chai HQ. Chai headquater. Chai headquarter. It will look good. So we give it to Chai headquater. So this is our project. It is obvious. Our work is done. After that we can go inside it. And run the server from manage.py. So this way you can make things easier for yourself by using documentation. So we go inside Chai HQ. And we say LS and show. Yes, you have a manage.py file. So python manage.py run server. Tell me what is the situation? Let's go to run server. Absolutely fine. Django is running. You know the steps of these migrations. Because we have already taken expertise in this. We have some users model. Which will go to admin. And they are not migrated yet. So if you remember the command, then search it. python manage.py make migrations. Everyone remembers after making 2-3 projects. Initially no one remembers. And then you migrate it. Migration was not needed here. But we did migrate. Now you will run. Run server. But that was not the goal. We had to go inside admin. So now I have to create a super user. But I don't remember the command. There was a command in docs. How to create a super user. So let's search. So here. Django admin. Django admin. Django models. Adding data to database. So here. We have to improve the searching. Update the admin. So this is the update of admin. We don't need this. We need. Let's search in the right side. Where will we get it. So here. Creating our first view. Adding template. Apps. Templates. Common layout. Alright. Relationship or forms. Update the admin. Adding form. So we have to improve this. How to see admins. Because we needed to get. Django project, Django server. Creating views. So this will be improved. Let's see. But in case we don't know. We know the command. So we need admin. So here. Create super user. Alright. Username. Email address. Hitesh at gmail.com. Password. Chai12345. Chai12345. Alright. Super user is created. So we can run the server. And. Let's see admin. Is it running? Admin is running. And chai12345. So this time. We are going so smoothly. Because we know the things. It's not a big deal. Alright. So we have done one thing. Let's do some more setup. After this. Let's see what else. So this is our chai head queue. Where we will do our major work. So we know some things. Which we have to do. Like images. We have to get it. So let's import the OS. You don't have to import in any configuration. So it doesn't matter. It's just a configuration. You can do it through OS. Or any utility. Whatever you want. But you have to do the configurations. So let's see. First of all. You have to do the media configuration. So media configuration. You will get it here. In django models. Creating views. Templates. So here. Pillow is installed. After that. Before adding data to database. We need a headline. So that we can search easily. So copy it. Here is the media URL. Nobody remembers it. So this is our media work. In case you want to work with static files. I think we have it in jinja templates. Apps in django. And static. Let's search. And static. Let's search. Static. So here are our static configurations. Alright. It should be here. Because there are URLs. Let's improve the docs. So that it is easy to search. Let's write it. We will keep it static. Same as before. You can keep your static assets. Like CSS. JavaScript. And serve it. So these are our assets. But they can't be used. Because you have to add static media. In URL. To add static media. Go to URLs. In the end. Where URL patterns are ending. And settings. Media URL. You saw. We need import settings. In django configuration. Nobody remembers it. You need static settings. So we have to see. Where are the settings coming from. Let's see. Alright. Here is our simple documentation. When we created django models. We have this configuration. This is static file configuration. You can copy it as it is. These are the top lines. Which import the assets. Let's import it. And this is the copy and paste. Plus static settings media. At least our documentation is ready. No need to do anything else. You should know. Where are the assets going. And how. In settings.py file. So I am writing media. And media root. If you have any other folder. Write it. I know static. It's not important. Where are you copying from. You should know. Foundation is solid. Now we have to. Settings.py file. Project is set. Close it. Now we create a new app. It's very easy. We go here. Start app. Start project is done. Now we do apps in django. Python manage.py start app. And then whatever app name. We copy it. These are the steps. Open it. Manage.py. And we name it tweet. Try tweet. Start app. Start project. Complete project. And then apps. Start tweet. You will get a new folder. We have this folder. In this folder. You don't get forms. Or urls. So the most common scenario. Is to make a file. Urls.py. I don't remember. So at least. I copy the urls.py file. And paste it. And then. We get the urls.py file. By default. Mostly. This is the basic. Of the app. How to get urls.py file. Basic. We will go more. But now. We don't need admin. Stop. And here also. We keep it empty. And. We comment it. And you don't need. Views. So make a view. And. You can't test the app. Is it working. So make a view. And make a template. Index.html. And insert it. So at least. Our app is in runnable format. So we make a small index. And put the request. And. We don't do much. Return the render. In suggestion. So. You know. You give the request. And which template you want to load. Index.html. So. We will do it. So now. We have a view. Now. How to use it. So. Import. From. Import views. Uncomment. We have a path. And in this path. We will put url patterns. So. Views.index. We have only one. And name it. Name equals. Index. Obviously we will change it later. We didn't import django url. Ok. So we deleted everything. We need a path. Copy. And paste. So we have a path. But we are not done yet. We don't have index.html. And. We didn't tell our url. That we have a new app. So first. Go to settings. And tell it to install a new app. Go to installed apps. And tell it. That we have installed a tweet. Comment. Ok. We have done this. Thank you so much. I am always thankful for your information. But. We have to configure templates. So templates. It is very easy. We have to join os path. But we will search in documentation. How to. Templates. If we get settings. It will be better. Ok. We didn't make. Customized templates. Let's see. Installed apps. If we get it. It will be easier. Let's search. Templates. Ginger templates. It should be here. We have defined a model. Add static files. And. It is wasting time. Sometimes. We have to hunt in documentation. But it was easy. So. Os.path.join. Os.path.join. Who has to join. Base directory. Base directory. And write. Templates. Now. You can put. Templates folder. We will put it outside. But for now. Now. Go to head queue. And make a new folder. Name. Templates. Make a new file. Name. Index.html. Add a template. Test template. This is how project setup. First you do testing. Test template. Walk through. We made a new app. Go to settings.py. Give information about app. We forgot template setting. We should have done it earlier. We did it. Go to urls.py. We didn't inform it. That we have a new app. Now we will take url control. Ok. Let's duplicate it. Let's duplicate it. Now. Whatever tweet related work. Whatever tweet related work. Whatever tweet related work. We will include it. First we need to include. include. include. And admin site. We don't need it. include. We include it. Because we already informed Django. Because we already informed Django. Otherwise you can't write. We have a tweet. We have a tweet. We have a tweet. We have a tweet. Go to urls.py. Go to urls.py. Now. Technically we have all control. After tweet. You can see. You will not get anything on home page. Go to tweet. And then control will be passed. In our tweet app. We go to urls.py. And there we will render. We will render view. With index name. And here it's name is also given. Now. We will render view. We will render index.html. And index.html. We have made this folder in chaiHQ No worries, mistakes happen We will move this in tweet and move Now we have a template and index.html This is a realistic ground This is how real application is made Sometimes you confuse the configuration like we did with templates This is how you analyze the flow Now hopefully we should have a situation Python manage.py run server Run server Here we have static directory settings does not exist There is a warning but why not Let's see where the problem is in static directory Alright It should not have come but let's go to settings and see if there is any static directory issue It should not be Static, OS path, base directory, settings Let's see this too Let's open our app It was expected that you will see this error page because our debug is true You can also define a view on the homepage and give a basic homepage My concern is in tweet Can I go to tweet I can see test template It is a bit too much Let's go to here Style Body BGC 0 0 and here color colon Hopefully now it will look better Ok, now it is fine Let's go to the next page Hopefully now it will look better Ok, now it is fine It was too much white At least now we have application ready static directory static directory There is a small issue Let's see At least now in the section we have tweet, admin properly admin configured properly tweet configured At least our situation is good Our project is in up and running stage and working This was our next segment How we setup the project Enabled admin Enabled media files Created app Informed our main project Configured settings Configured urls Configured template We have a smooth experience Now we can configure a project Now how to work in a project How to use forms We will discuss that in next video For me next video, for you next segment See you in next video Alright We are in another segment You are watching together So video is not for me Let's go to this segment What we will do in this segment First we will configure our layout Base template We will configure it Then we will make models And then we will connect it With our back end admin It's a small task No problem We will do it together Have tea Tell me, have you subscribed yet Or you are watching like this You can subscribe But you have to say something for sharing That's not a big issue Let's go Let's share screen I forgot to share screen Now what to do First of all I fixed static bug It was a warning Now it's not coming Simple reason was I forgot to make static folder Now we have static folder Where we have to make We have a project named ChaiHQ In that we have to make static We have to make it in configuration file It's not a big task It's done Now next We have to configure templates Where we have to configure We have templates in tweet Project And often Almost every time We have a base template Or layout template It's kept in project Because we have to make project level same So here We make a folder And in this template I make layout.html Now you can call it layout or base It's totally up to you It doesn't matter So we have a basic boilerplate template Now in this We do 2-3 things Which is considered as standard practice First of all We load static Static Static Load static Load static So first of all It doesn't matter If you have static assets or not It's a standard practice In case if any user added later At least he doesn't get bothered So this is basic Now in this title We remove this document And here we add a block So unnamed Block And we name this block title If someone wants to manipulate this Then it's easy But if someone didn't give any title Then we keep it as Chai and Django It will be branding also Chai and Django After that We need a simple block content Which we can serve in body So we make a div And class it Container So everything looks good in a class And we do Unnamed block Content Content Now it's up to you What you want to name this block Whatever you want This is our basic template layout Now we need to extend this template Which we will do Before that Let's arrange our CSS I know many of you will say Why bootstrap Hitesh You told tailwind and shadcn It totally depends on you Many of you want to use CSS manually I wanted to work fast We thought it's been a long time Let's use this I have already taught you tailwind in series You can inject it The way we inject It's not an optimized way Here When you say you want to install this You get this CSS library Like this This library We will use this And inject it It's a little bloated But it's good We don't have to do much Let's inject it Now our page Has bootstrap enabled We have done one thing Now Let's wrap content In this How is our content Here Our content looks like this Let's modify it Let's go to our project Which is tweet Templates and index.html I don't want to give index Because it's bootstrap We will extend it Let's take extends And our file is layout No need to give the whole path Because automatically It will search in project level Otherwise it will be in your project It will be there No problem This is our basic Now we come to a block Unnamed block And the first block is title So that whatever code is written here It will be injected there So we will call it Chai or tweet Chai or tweet We know everything You must know this much This is basic Now let's add block content Unnamed And this is Content It will depend on the name of the block Let's take a simple h1 Let's do this You come here And write Welcome to Chai Chai's Django project We know which content is coming from where How is it coming It's a little white But it will work Don't worry We will not make your eyes so white So for that We will use a little knowledge of bootstrap You also learn together It's not a big deal If you have not shared the video, then subscribe You do it sometimes So we come here And let's say it simple Make bg dark This is a simple class And we have Welcome to Chai Django project But bg dark So everything is dark So every text You can give it inside the body Or how you want to add it So There are two or three things in it How you can navigate it For now bg dark So automatically Content should be white Technically If not, then we will see it later Add class here And let's call it Text-center And let's call it text-white Let's see It will work Little margin Top-4 It will work So we are not going to write much css But our work is done Now I know I will write pages here I need a common navigation bar We will pick it from bootstrap Simple So here are the components Navbar And here is our navbar Pick whatever you like No problem I will pick this one Copy to clipboard Let's go to code section Because it will come everywhere Let's go to layout Let's do it in container It will work Add Save And write it Tweetbar I don't know why Let's see And now We will get this tweetbar in every page We can do something else We have navbar And expanded Body Let's see In bootstrap Background dark Bg-dark Dark mode Enable dark mode You tell me how it will be enabled In html Bstheme dark I think it will be like this Let's do it Alright Let's go to html In layout And in layout html I think we don't need to Enable bg-dark Let's see And reload Alright I think we don't need to Enable text-white Save and reload Everything is working Navbar Tweetbar And buttons Everything is working At least we have a basic layout It will not look bad And this is the main goal If you are going to use tailwind You will get components From your associate Or from a company Or from a component library So What to do next Let's pause Put a timestamp We have done the layout Add a major timestamp I will add a major timestamp You can add a major timestamp Alright Now let's make models Go to tweet And tell models.py We have to make a model Not much But only one First we will import django This will be interesting It is a little long Eventually you will remember There is an auth In which you get models You can import the user This is the file Where you can see The user group In the admin panel This user group Comes from here All the users If you want to use the whole Existing It is editable You can change anything You can change the username Email Everything is configurable It is just a file First we will Create a tweet From where we will get the tweet class Models.models This is a basic syntax structure First we will associate the user This is our classic SQL 101 Or you can say SQL Databases 101 We have primary keys Foreign keys Every tweet is associated with a user Without the user's tweet We are not taking unknown tweets We will inject foreign keys To inject foreign keys Two parameters are major Which table do you want to refer We want to refer this user table That's why we brought One is on delete So that the database will not get messed up In the last videos I told you to read cascade Many of you have also answered Read what is cascade After that We need text field Obviously tweet is text We have two options For text One is text field And the other is char field So char field Is like an input A simple input Like when you fill name and email Why am I telling this Because we will auto generate forms It is important To choose text field or char field So choose char field And text field Will be a big text field We will use that So we bring text field In text field You can define max length We are taking 240 characters You can take as many characters as you want After that We need photo We have image field We have read it last Here is image field Now we need to tell image field Where to keep all the material So we say Put it in photos Here is photos You can put tweets photos As you want Now it is up to you If you want to allow tweet normal I will make it true So that you can tweet without photo If you make it true Now it is basic Now There is no Interested field But we will keep it Created underscore at It will help you in database You will know when values are created We will keep it Date time field And we will make it Auto now add true Here you go In case if you manipulate We can do it So updated at We will keep it Sometimes We need to pause video So that we can work So we were Created at And we need to make updated at So this is also easy Let's take date time field Why to think more about it And we will make it auto now true Here you go Auto now add and auto now true So automatically And auto now add Will run at the same time So this is Basic model And we will add Dunder Underscore underscore string And we will call it Self Here The benefit is When we will integrate it in admin We will get demo Or url To see other fields We will modify it Nothing else Formatted string And insert User name Self.user.username To get user name Models are defined And we will take text With dash Self Self.text You can take whole text Or slice it Let's take 10 characters Ok Now models are defined This was major work Models are defined Let's migrate this And see what else So come here First it said add pillow Yes we forgot Now we know It's not a big work Just add pillow Copy Kill and add pillow Now i will tell you Now we open requirement.txt So we added requirement.txt Whenever you add anything Freeze pip Freeze means dependency And redirect it Requirement Requirement .txt And whatever additional Will be added Ok We added it Pillow is here We should have done outside But you understood We did it outside Because we are here So we made it outside So we take it outside Copy Paste Save Save We don't need inside We did it outside But it's ok You will do it Ok Now we will Migrate it Python Manage.py Make Migrations Don't forget We have to do tweet migration Migration Migration Migrate Migrate Migrate Run server Hopefully Everything is ok Let's refresh We didn't get it Because we didn't register it in admin After model We have to register in admin.py It's easy Import Tweet From .models Now we have to register it Register it in admin.py Register Who else? Tweet Just save Nothing much And refresh Now we have 0 tweets We have one user Hitesh First Tweet For big project Image Start from backend english Start Save That's it Some characters We have Now it's ok Now we have Models create Now we have to create forms Create new file in tweet Because forms are not there By default Common mistake Forms.py Common mistake Spelling mistake I have more spelling mistake No problem Now we have to create forms First import jango forms Then models Standard practice From jango Import forms From .models Import We have only one model Tweet Now forms Is very basic You create forms Because you want to associate Existing models With jango models You don't have to work hard You can do it You can pass data in views But we don't want to We want to use jango We will create such projects Where we want to use our own forms We will do it in future If you subscribe And share We name it Tweet form We import Forms Model form Jango gives you Standard format You create a meta class No other option You have to create First you have to give Model Then fields We give Model Tweet Fields Fields Is an array If there was something else You get suggestions But you have to write manually I don't like it This text and photo Is not in air I wrote it Because I called it text If there is any other field You can add it This is all This is our models This is our forms Now next What to do Logical section Is views We have to write a lot of views Because Views 3-4 views List all urls Edit Add Delete We will do it in next segment Or in next video Hopefully you are following Do it in comments This much section is complete Do you like it? See you in next segment How are you? Good morning Greetings Morning is early I thought to record videos For you Let's go We have done a lot of work In our project Let's start Let's share screen We have reached here We have to start Some work on views Till now We have done Models Forms We have registered In admin Now last work is To do on views Because We will define functionality And where will views act Will be in our jinja template Which is simple html template We will see templates later First we will discuss on views Because that is major work After that everything will be easy Let's do it one by one First work We have to do import statements So that we can import things So We import things First We need models Without models we can do anything We import We have tweet model We have to import from forms We import From.forms Import Tweet form Let's check Tweet form We need these two Other than this We don't have many options And one more Get objects Because jango Put layers With which you can interact With database And you get shortcuts in jango So from Jango.shortcuts Import Get Get list and 404 Get object and 404 You can use other It's not a big deal Ok Import is done We discuss each functionality And make it First functionality All tweets List on one page For that We make a function Tweet underscore list Give name as you want Basic Done How to get tweets Use tweet model Always use objects After this You have to tell By dot To create I want all Dot all I want all All You can order by I do Dash This is weird In jango You have to write string But ok Whatever you have Do it It depends On how you are getting Tweets It depends on All tweets And how to improve Store all Return Render Send request Send request Send tweet list Send tweet list On which page Send We have no template But tweet underscore list Do it later Pass data Tweet Where is data Here From tweets Suggestion Here Done All tweets I will tell you How to modify How to improve I will give you assignment Don't worry First We have list Second Method Tweet underscore create Request When you Create tweet How to create User has to give form In that form User has submitted Accept Give empty form Standardized Standard First Request Handle request Second Give empty form Third User has submitted Render Easy First Handle Data Pass Next Else Take form How to create As it is Form Form is here Finally After else Whatever you have Empty form Return Render Request Tweet form Tweet underscore form Dot html Send Data Form Form Standardized Basic Any given how You have form Available If not This is case When we give empty form How to handle Request Method Request method Request post Request post Obvious Post request Standardized Form Tweet form Tweet form Tweet form Request dot post Post level If Optionally Accept file Request dot files component Takes Request dot file Success Possible Request equals post data files which tells the form whether it is valid or not because Django also gives some built-in security features like CSRF security, cross-site request forgery cannot be done so for that you can keep a simple method here that form.is I should have got the suggestion but it is not coming is valid if this method is executed then only we will process the form this line handles a lot of security measures and you will see this almost everywhere now what we have to do we have to save the tweet but the tweet that we have made, designed we are taking the data in it but who has sent that data so we also need that user because here you see there is a user but the user will not come from the form so how can we take it it is a very easy job whenever a form is filled with that automatically you get the user in Django so see what we do first, first worry about the form so we save the form ok the form that we are saving here it is necessary to put one option in it which is our commit commit equals false because I don't want to save it in the database I have just saved the form so once the form is with you suppose we hold it in a variable here we have handled the tweet now we have to add one more property in this tweet object which is user tweet.user now where will this user come from because it is not coming in the form but it comes in every request so here we have also appended the user now I will save this tweet now as soon as I say tweet save because I have not given any commit or false now the tweet is saved in my database now when the tweet is saved so what we do we also do a redirect ok so do we have a redirect no we don't have so it is not a big deal, we will bring the redirect we will get the redirect in the shortcuts so get object 404 and here is our redirect now the redirect is with you here it is now if you want to redirect it is totally up to you you can do it on the tweet list we do it on the tweet list it is a very simple thing I can use it here redirect I don't like this one but you have to give it in strings ok apart from personal opinion you must have understood how forms are handled this is the standard way you may be using django forms or you may be using customised forms mostly this is the major work ok so our tweet is created now how to edit the tweet this is also an interesting case because in django you can use the same tweet form to edit you will understand that too so let's define a method and call it tweet underscore edit same thing request now you know what to do basic thing is if and else else you have a simple form here it is and how did you get this form we got it from tweet form now we have to pass something in this instance equals to tweet now I don't have this tweet this tweet is not there so obviously this tweet will come now we declare a variable we will discuss about it now we will empty it we have added instance tweet because we have a lot of data because it is an edit functionality so I want to prefill the form so we need some data in tweet so obviously we are adding this instance this is done now as it is we don't have any difference here it is indent it return render, request same tweet form and send the data this is done now how to edit first you need data it is not like you can edit all tweets you will get some data so the easiest way is get object and 404 you will get object or 404 we will pass 2-3 parameters first is tweet now where did this tweet come from let's take it in capital so you will get request and parameters we will call it tweet underscore id you can call it id, tweet id now in get 404 first parameter is tweet this is model which model should I see but which primary key so in that primary key you can pass tweet id so we call it tweet underscore id now here tweet underscore id in url also you have to write tweet underscore id in url also standard 101 but not only this we want to give one more thing user can edit any tweet but I don't want edit form to be available for all if your tweet is available then we can give one more parameter you can find it but you can also add and user should be request dot user so whatever request is being sent it will be sent by the one who is logged in so we will keep that in mind and we got one tweet now what we do now we come to condition now we say request dot if we have method request dot if we have method post so if request dot method post exactly same as above you can copy paste exactly same but but one more thing when you are giving edit tweet you have to use instance we will give instance of tweet so how will you know that you are editing old tweet so this form is designed where you have instance and tweet now you know that form is instance of tweet so we have to save it saving is same almost same in django so people develop in django because everything is same now when you know form dot is valid you will take it it will take care of our security now you know that i will save tweet but i will false commit form dot save and commit i will false commit because i have to add user so here is tweet but we will keep standard formula you can ignore it now you can see that user is saved now i can save tweet here is tweet now when you are done you can re-direct and where you want to redirect you can do it in tweet list tweet underscore list now you can edit tweet now tweet is edited and created now we have to delete tweet delete now we are here tweet underscore delete same thing now you can see that i want id while editing so while deleting i want tweet id so we will take id now same standard thing no no when you are deleting you can give a button but button is doing some activity so you need post method and we need to know which is tweet so we will use get object and pass all data in tweet model and i will pass on primary key and user user equals request request.user now we have all data so we can hold it now we have tweet now you can see that your method is post or not so we will see if request. method if it is post so we have to do something so here you don't need to see valid you can see here but because form is not coming so validation of form is not important now we will tweet.delete now delete now here once delete is done so redirect so return redirect and where to redirect so tweet underscore list now when you have done so we will delete but if you have method not come so you need confirmation that where it will be because in every case you have to render form because it is templating language so we use this and here if method is in form but where it will be rendered because view will render something this will be done when you are sending post request before sending post request something will be displayed like here also but before post request something will be displayed we have done this everywhere so same in delete this is work of deletion but before that we need something to render if you are sending directly but here we will do tweet deletion tweet confirm underscore delete dot html now this is done and here we don't need to send form but we will keep tweet data because we know that tweet and we call this tweet ok so here we have tweet object whenever we need to do something else we will do it so this is our basic if there is any bug or spelling mistake we will fix it later but i think now you know how to do crud operation the major story after this is how you fetch data jango's ORM is very easy very straightforward it doesn't bother you in sql like here get object 404 there are many methods mostly you will use dot object and then you need all or specific so we will do all that there is no big work so here we complete all views of this segment and now we will see in next video how to make templates so let's go to next segment for you yes in this segment we will see how to design our jinja templates simple html templates nothing much and then we will see how many bugs are there expect that application will run directly so i think this is new like our application runs in one go no one can run everyone has to debug so let's start jinja templates comment target and all you have completed and now you will not make pressure when video will come we take time but we do best so that you can understand we don't make content blindly so it takes time you support us so let's share screen now let's close this because all work is done now let's open templates because we need to create so index.html is not needed because it is done next we need tweetlist.html copy this and make a new file new file in templates and tweetlist.html tweetlist.html file doesn't have much work so you don't worry let's make all files tweetform.html copy this and new file tweetforms.html and tweetlist.html same form in edit and copy this and new file paste now let's copy basic html and paste it paste paste paste now let's start let's go to tweetlist how to make tweets list it is not that complex it is basic first of all we are using bootstrap before coming to end block let's create a button so that user can create and where this button will go this is interesting so let's use jango templates so that it is easy to go so this is done now here we give a url now where this url will go tweet underscore create this is a good thing that this work is done easily so we have given a reference now we have to write something in this tweet so let's write create new tweet create a tweet it will be better now because this is a simple tag so let's give a class and bootstrap class is btn btn dash primary primary so this work is done now let's make a row so div.container.row so this is a basic bootstrap row let's give a gap so that every card has a gap now first we need a loop so we write a for loop and for loop should have come yes it came so from which loop we have to make for tweet in tweets because here if you remember in views all the listing was tweets and we were sending these tweets so we are looping on these tweets and from here we will do the work now what we do is do you want to loop in or repeat again and again for that the easiest thing is to go to bootstrap and pick a card it will be easy to work ok let's pick this first card and let's paste it so we will repeat this card now we have to inject data so to inject data we have to inject image so here we can inject image so here we have injected the template now we know that we have called a single object tweet and we have called it photo in database but it doesn't come only from photo we have to give url also so we have a photo here you can give the card title or you can give the tweet text and here we give username tweet.user.username now we give the tweet text now we have to give the tweet text here we give tweet. tweet. tweet.text here we go so we have the tweet text and now we have a button which is called go somewhere now we will do nothing with button but btn is primary so we will make it edit button and delete button it's a simple task let's write edit but this url will go somewhere so we will do the same here we go we have started the templating url will go somewhere here it will go to edit tweet underscore edit here we go so this is our edit but it can't go to edit alone it has to send url also because you know every tweet is repeating we have access to the primary key so you can send more data on any views here we have to send only tweet.id so here we send id and now we have edit button similarly we will make delete button here we go and we will give it btn danger so that the button will look red now this url will go to tweet underscore delete and you will need tweet id there also and i think that's it let's run it it's running so we come here and obviously we didn't put anything on the home page so we come to tweet and reload it so i think we have any tweet let's go to admin and refresh we have one tweet but it's not showing because we didn't put url because we didn't put url so let's test it let's give url it's not a big deal let's discuss it one by one let's copy it and let's show the listing actually let's show it on the home page so here instead of index you can shift index somewhere else we will edit tweet list and let's make name also tweet list tweet underscore list so hopefully now we have url let's refresh and here slash tweet tweet create not found tweet create not valid tweet create oh because we don't have url so we have to give url of tweet create alright let's give it tweet create because we have to give both tweet create because if we don't have both then we will have issue because template is loading them tweet create and delete edit so let's write them one by one first create then edit tweet edit and change them here is create and here is edit because everything is loading in first template so we have to do url if we want to test and here we have tweet underscore delete now let's go to their views I will list them on the home page and here is create I don't want any id while creating so that's it let's move to next line it will look easy and when I am doing edit then I need id so whenever you take id first angular bracket or diamond bracket in integer format and I am calling it tweet underscore id it is important to say tweet underscore id because it is written in views and here I am mentioning url tweet id is here and here tweet id will populate in the views this syntax automatically pass on views so let's copy it and same thing we have to do in delete so here we are slash delete slash so hopefully we have deleted now when we save it and refresh we can see it let's modify it I am not going to do much this is for you so in button margin bottom 4 I think 4 is fine so we have create tweet and here is edit button and delete button for now it is working but when I am going to edit button I didn't set the template so I think we have template for create now let's do create urls are set now let's confirm no no no we have to create so let's discuss form now to take form it is very easy first we need a text in content welcome to chai jango let's leave h1 and declare h2 now I want text in h2 now the problem is what should be text edit tweet or create new tweet so for this you can use jango's template here we have template now we will ask if form .instance.pk is a primary key instance so what we will do here we will write edit tweet and we will use else case if it is not then we will write create tweet and after this we will end so this is end f here so I think we can do better it will be easier to understand what we are doing now I am used to see like this so here we will write edit tweet if form is instance means form is for edit this is the way to see else we will write create tweet so at least we will see if we click on create tweet so here we are seeing edit tweet now we will make form this is the most interesting when jango's form is made it is very easy so here we have made form we need form of post method we don't need action this is also good one thing we want to do we want to give encryption type enc type we are giving this type because form is accepting images this is html 101 so we will call it multipart form multipart slash form dash data so now our form images or any file it will accept this is basic html 101 so this is form let's add class let's form and that's it now how to make form take two template string and write form it will work in this but you can write dot as p it will render as paragraph you can write form directly let's refresh and see form it doesn't look beautiful you need to add more css we are not doing it but we are seeing how powerful jango is that i didn't have to make form now we have image and photo if you didn't give it as p we would have rendered it but we don't have any problem so we prefer to render it as paragraph now let's see what are the mistakes we create a button and type btn dot btn dash warning nothing just simple form it will look orange type submit it will automatically submit write submit and call it you can write whatever you want if you want to go back add a tag which is simple where you want to go back tell that write url and send it tweet underscore list and here back to tweet list done refresh tweet, submit back to tweet list shift it done now this form will not be submitted why? suppose i write tweet from front end and choose a photo tech exploration and submit it you will see csrf verification failed this is the code we wrote we said in views jango does it but we said form should be valid in this case whenever you submit a form jango has a compulsory to inject csrf security we do it too we have csrf token it will do all the work what happens with csrf token you go to back and refresh it right click inspect and this is the input type hidden and csrf middleware token is an application by default and whenever you refresh it is connected to your backend so much work whenever you refresh new value will come now you want to do css id underscore text text area is easy dashlane is not you don't need it basically it can be edited and now check it this is tweet from frontend with chai it will be with chai it will be morning let's take this submit we have a new tweet this tweet is from the frontend now we go to edit as soon as we go to edit we don't have to do anything because everything was already written same edit tweet this tweet is from frontend with chai you can change the photo or you can clear it or submit it this tweet is frontend from chai with edit feature and obviously we have to do word blocking we have to submit and now we have to delete we have to delete because the confirmation form of delete is still empty let's show you let's go and change the text are you sure that you want to delete the tweet this is done now we need a form which is post type we don't need multi part oops because we are not sending any data we are getting only form data but what is the most important thing first we do regular work then we will do important work we do button and we put class btn and btn-danger and we delete this button will come and when the button is here someone may want to cancel so we put a ref here and we put it to URL tweet list tweet underscore list then user will go back and we put cancel and in this also we put classes it's not expensive btn- success it will look fine and now we delete this in this delete option Delete option is there, it is cancelled. But it will not be deleted again. Because as soon as you delete, the same CSRF verification failed. And it should be, because this is also going into a database. But now you know why that error comes, how it comes, so you can simply go into that form and inject a CSRF. So here is the CSRF token. Now you go here. Now let's come back. Let's refresh. And delete the first tweet. And let's call it delete. So the tweet is deleted. Now the problem is that I was the one who tweeted this. That's why I am able to delete it. Very easily. So let's do this much in this section. That we have done it. Although we still have some work to do. But I think now you have understood that yes, the whole CRUD functionality, whether you call it Twitter or Instagram, whatever you call it, it's a play on layout. Whether you want to give it a layout like Twitter or whatever layout you want. Now we have edited on big buttons. You could have edited on a pencil icon. It was a very basic task. It's done. So let's do this much in this section. Take care of the comment section. And we will meet you in the next segment. Yes, so now let's talk about some protection. How can we protect routes? How can you use decorators to protect your URLs, views, etc. And how can you do custom user registration? Although the custom user authentication of Django, which is already given by the user table, can be modified in many ways. Many people don't like to use it. They link to a further table. It's also good to do that. But it depends on what is your use case, what kind of project you are making. But at least in this segment, you will get a very good basic idea how you can handle those tables, how you can see it. Because Django's inbuilt user registration is very powerful in itself. It is much better to use it. It has only one small drawback that it takes everything user name based, not email based. By the way, you can add that field. It's not a big deal. It can be done easily. So let's see how the route protection is done. The video can be a little lengthy because we will discuss a lot of things. But okay, we will discuss it with tea. Now, the first thing, see, I am able to create and see all the tweets. But as soon as I copy it and go to an incognito mode, I am able to create tweets here too. But there will be no user. Obviously, there will be an issue. Now if I say test here and if I choose a file, suppose this is the file, as soon as I submit here, there will be issues because there is no auth, no models, no user. So obviously, these URLs, these anonymous pages, which are errors pages, we can do better with them. We can give more responses here. But the thing is that users are needed. These messages can be made better. There is no problem in that. But the thing is that now the time has come to give protection to the user that you can't click on the creed. All this. So let's define. First, let's come to our views. Let's remove everything else. We don't need everything else. And we don't need these templates either. Let's go. Now I want that this is fine, it is kept like this. There is nothing of this. Tweet list. Do you want to protect this? No, I don't want to do this because this is kept by itself. It will be fine if everyone can see the tweets. But I want to protect the creation part. So how can we do it in the standard way? In Django, decorators are also available. So from django.contrib You get all the work in the auth-related contrib. And here you get one thing which is very powerful which is decorators. Now I have taught decorators in my python series very well. I have taken many examples. And those who have understood those examples must have found out that this is a very easy job. Like if you want to protect create route then I don't have to do anything. I have to do a decorator on it which wraps that function in itself with any functionality. So I said login created. That's it. Now it's done. Now it's up to you what all things you want to protect. Like I want to protect edit. So we will put it on this too. So we will write here too at login required. That's it. I said in Django when things are easy then it's very easy. Once you know that it has to be easy like this then what to say. So now as soon as I save it that's it. I wrote this much code. Let's refresh here. Let's copy this. Let's open in incognito. Now at least it's protected. If I say create new tweet then it says no you can't do it. We also have a very interesting URL which says accounts slash login Okay. We don't have this defined yet. We will do that too. And it also takes care of next that after login where you have to take next. So a lot of work has been done. But obviously it's not done yet. But yes progress is progress. So let's go. Now we have done this work. Now what we have to do is we need some user registration and all this. So what we do is we use Django's forms and get user registration too. So we come to forms forms.py and do it here. Some people want to keep it separate but usually it is kept here in Django. So we define a simple class which is called user registration form user registration form Now this form because it's not a common form but the one we want to use is Django's inbuilt form because Django also gives you the same form during admin time and Django has its own models so through those models you get an inbuilt form. How many fields you have to activate from those forms you tell us. Again the same thing you will get auth in contrib so django.contrib you will get auth in it Now from this auth I want to get forms this time. And from here you import a user creation form you get it in user change form Now you have got the user creation form so use it Now you have got the user creation form you take it here. Now it depends on you what other fields you want to add or not. I will add an email field here so how will we get the email nothing, same forms and you take an email field if you want to give more fields you can take that too. Rest is the same class you will get a meta class you have to mention fields in it no suggestion? No, ok you have to take fields now these fields are tuple whatever you want to call it now in this you have to see what you want. Oh, we forgot to define model as we did in the beginning so here model will also be user so the model we want is user now we don't have user that's right so we will also get user so in contrib we don't need form we need models and which model will come from here? only one, user so here is the user model now which fields you want to keep? tell me in tuple now the interesting thing is here we gave array here we have to give tuple because here we are using built in forms built in table you will remember it after few times so here you have taken user name and you have to give email and one interesting thing in django is your passwords whenever you take from user you have to give password1 and password2 this is also modifiable but you have fields like this so that you can use both passwords and all the inbuilt security features of django so we have user registration form now let's go to views what we have to do with views now i want to make a view where user can register if he couldn't register then what is the benefit? so let's make a view so this is called simple register this is the view we will not give any suggestion don't give so here we have register now what we want work will be same but we have to keep one thing in mind where to keep default templates whenever you make this kind of django so where you will keep login form you will keep in outer templates because app is centric it's not about authentication so you have to make a special folder in templates and here you have to keep registration here only you have to keep registration and there are 2-3 files in registration so let's make a new file these are expected files register.html here we will hand over all the registration views one is login.html and one is logged out logged underscore out by the way it's not a documentation we are teaching from documentation everyone is teaching from there so this is our register route now what we have to do we have to keep same files and then we have to keep html render return so let's copy and paste it so it's easier now I have this request and this form I don't want it here I want it in registration register dot html so here you have given register.html form you have to give a form which we will make now and here we remove it so this is our form now let's take an if else where we have to see method post request or regular form or how to do it so let's take an if and pass and else and in else case you will get a form which is user registration form haven't you imported it? tweet form user registration form not creation user registration form so we have user registration form and now user registration form so here is our form now in if case also we have to make this form if else so in if case also method request post request dot method if we have post so what we will do let's remove this so now we have to make a form how to make it? but this time request dot post and let's make it here is our form ok so when we did above also it was almost same we have directly tweet form was also same request dot post and request dot files we were passing some other data now we have to make request dot post so we have made a form instance exactly same now we will check again whether form is valid or not it is always standardized form dot is valid here is form so we will make it user now here are few interesting things if you want you can save user directly but we will take user let me tell you few things so that it will be useful for you and we will make same commit false that form is not saved yet so here you can check password and you can also take cleaned data from form many times read this clean data it gives you stripping cleansing and many other things so what we do we give you method dot set underscore password because it is jango inbuilt so here you can set password and most easily you can take data from form so whenever you want to take data from form you can see here cleaned data method this is very interesting method so what we will take from this whatever you want you can pass in string and take name for now i will take password1 because i am using jango form so i got password1 and password2 and if you don't remember password1 password2 email username whatever you want you can take data from form like this here we have used set password method but this process you have to manipulate you can do all this after that we save user now after saving user we can log in i don't have to do anything i can log in directly now you will ask how to log in you have to bring login from jango contrib jango contrib gives you method here you can see auth and from auth we import login because you have data you can pass all login functionality from jango contrib because user registration is problem login will be same so just log in we will pass user because we have user so we have to request and we pass user you can redirect as you want now we do return redirect redirect to tweet underscore list this is how you design functionality this is done but it will not work now you will see in urls.py you can duplicate this and from here you can run registration on register slash we will give you views.register and we will change the name register will it work? this is very interesting let's try now we copy this and open it in incognito mode now we should not work but as soon as i create a tweet we get a issue url configured in urls jango tried these parameters jango doesn't know that there is a URL because it is going to account slash login this is jango configuration jango settings is issue we have to handle it now if you know jango settings is issue we have to define where are the urls for that we go to headq and settings.py here you have to define where are the urls where is login redirect where is logout redirect you can change it manually one of the most common is login underscore url where is our login url we will go to slash accounts slash login we said this is our login url this is login url you can define logout url and other urls so what we do login underscore redirect underscore url now we have redirected it so we can say you go to tweet sorry not chai you go to tweet logout url slash now we know login url is account slash login but where is redirect login redirect now we will do logout redirect so that we can see error page here you have redirected so we have redirected existing login url and we have enabled account slash login now we have redirected it to slash tweet now we will see what problems we face copy it again paste it now we will see what issues we face create a tweet because i am not login but we have issue this is also interesting issue let's solve it now we have a small issue we have told settings but it doesn't know account slash login or slash accounts because we can redirect login so obviously it makes sense it is happening in url it is right that you are not able to configure url let's configure it now there is not much we have to do few things when we change it where user registration will be first thing copy it and we will go to account and in account include and we will not give tweet we will give jango and i don't like this so i will write jango .contrib because i get suggestion .auth we need this and we get url from it so we will copy it and paste it here and we don't need this do we need it? now we can do one more thing import a small setting views as auth underscore views these are views so it will not clash with our views so login it like this one thing is done now we will import this we will save it and see if our problem is solved so we will go back and refresh and create tweet now we have accounts login and create now we don't have error we have improvement but at least improvement now you must have understood why this problem is coming because we have register.html but we don't have anything if we had something in register.html then it would have been helpful so let's write a test test register is this the problem? now we go back and refresh and create tweet this is not of register let's try login test login save and go back refresh now we know how to redirect now we have control over flow now we will do register login first extend layout.html and then unnamed blog name it content and here we need a form post form no action needed and here is the form you must have understood that you need csrf token so here is the csrf token and then we will render jango form form .as p now we have rendered the form now we will add a submit button button btn .btn- primary and we will call it register so this is the form let's copy this and we will make login form like this register is ready now we need to modify login we will write h2 because we don't know which form it is login form and here register form that's it now we need to redirect login if it doesn't have url or something like that so we will redirect it it is written like this don't have an account so please login register here and here here redirect url now it is there so it will be done you can do the same on the register page if you have an account then login it is important to logout we need to have logout account nothing much just a basic content copy and paste so that there is no error extend layout, block content logout logged out here we don't need to give anything else you have been logged out and no need of form change it you have been logged out and login again login here and change url here it is hopefully it is done let's refresh now we have login form, username, password register form, email password, password confirmation password 2 is there so it is done now one more thing let's register a new user let's do it virat virat at chai.com and password whatever you want password security will be same let's register now we come to create tweet so here it is add photo this one is good submit now problem is virat has tweeted edit button is visible to all virat edits his tweets but it is not required but when you go to edit you get an error no tweet matches the given query because he didn't have same user so we have protection virat can edit his own tweets but why to show it to all you are right so can we modify it to show it to users optionally so that card listing is not visible to all yes we can now we go to headquarter many are open let's close close chai.hq and open templates and go to listing now the thing is edit and this we have to render them when we have user here is a small if condition if tweet.user because you have the object here is tweets we are looping so we can check the user in tweets is it user this is very interesting you can access this user anywhere in jango templates because user is part of request and this is the best thing you can dump this user object to see the information but if we have this option then only we want to show edit and delete option it was not that difficult and if save let's refresh now virat is tweeting and hitesh is not showing edit and delete button only virat is showing this work is done now you want to do more work like navbar or layout so we can do that I think let's do that because logout feature is also here so let's go now to templates and layout so in layout we have search button and this is the form it is not that useful but why not you can enable search feature now we want to give 2-3 buttons to the user one button is for home so that they can reach to the tweet list so in a tag we will put classes btn and btn-primary and we will inject url where you want to go you want to go to tweet list tweet underscore list and we will write tweet home I think now as we refresh we have tweet home and let's add more classes margin x-2 now you have tweet home on x-axis I think everyone should see tweet home but only authenticated users should see logout otherwise login and logout so let's inject our if else case and we have it so first check if as I told you you can access user anywhere and this user has properties because jango is famous for this you don't need to check authentication you don't need to inject middleware underscore is underscore authenticated middleware is already installed now let's add else case we have it a small else case and we have it and if now if user is authenticated then logout button should be seen now the most interesting thing logout is not a button it is a form it looks like a button but actually it is a form so you need a form which type? post type you don't need action but you need to give a form because it is a matter of authentication jango takes it very seriously so first we come to post you have given it now you have to give action in action, you have to list the url and and where do we have to give url simple logout now we will have a problem we will handle it but there is a problem let me tell you so this is your form the first thing yes, you can see csrf token now you can make a simple button in this and give it a class button btn-danger and where will this button go logout one button automatically submits but still why take the risk give it, it will take only one keyword type submit here you go now the problem is if I refresh it you have a logout button btn-danger refresh now you have a logout button now we will open incognito mode let's copy one more what is the cost of opening here also you have tweet logout and tweet home incognito tweet home refresh it let's logout incognito is also carrying on and logout nice I think there should be an issue but no, it's good you can create tweet so you can log in and get the form now let's do one more thing logout button is done now you will need more buttons which are a tag so let's copy tweet home now in this case you will see login and register buttons so let's call it register and where will you go URL you will go to login no, register sorry because you are a register and duplicate you will go to login and change it login and change both success URL changes here is logout button let's copy incognito mode and here is login and register button now we know we can do register let's log in and see username virat password and when I register it automatically shows create tweet not home page so many things are inbuilt in django it's good tweet home is also working so functionality design is not that much now let's do assignments now you have to define search functionality search functionality is just a form nothing else data will come from this form you have to search using django ORM search on tweet text very easy ORM and then you have to create a new view with that a new template will be created where search results will come do a small exercise come to our discord community many people do such assignments and help each other now you have to implement search functionality search button and you can see front end keyword and only that is listed very easy and you can do it easily I think this project was very interesting we studied about django inbuilt models and how to manipulate them how to use django inbuilt forms and super power this was a very good project we created, edited and rendered things it was very good now we have come to this point now we are very in depth about django we have done a very good project we have to do further exploration but now we are in this position in the coming days or months whenever you get time you can create complex projects where you can use your own forms and not django's you can send customized data create views, design e-commerce or any other application we will use it there now in django you don't use bootstrap some people do, please tell them we have not used bootstrap you can use material tailwind and many other things but I think this was our final project we have completed django and we will end the series with this but there will be more videos we will talk about new features and innovations so keep giving suggestions we will listen to them and we will do it but I think we will end the series with this because the series is important and ending it is also important so that you know that now I can work on my own you have to create a search bar create a search form all the functionality features of django I know in depth how this framework works how it operates where the problems can be how I can solve them and you can take help from google chat gpt, discord no issues and if you have not subscribed please do it I enjoyed making this series you gave a lot of love you gave a lot of support because of that I was able to do so much otherwise who records the series at 3 or 4 in the night it's all your love thank you so much for that and keep drinking tea we will arrange for the code see you in the next video"
