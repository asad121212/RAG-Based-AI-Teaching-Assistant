    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai Aur Code and we are continuing our Django series it's quite fun In this video, we will extend the series a little more First time we will hit some documentation of Django officially and one of the most important thing is Jinja Now what is this new word here? Jinja version 2 is used in Django by default There are many other templating engines but I have rarely seen a company which changes the default templating engine and brings in another engine in Django All the production grade apps are mostly run in Jinja and all the developers like Jinja because you don't have to add any further extension we write normal HTML files where we have to inject variables or loop something then it is injected directly in the HTML file By default, the extension of Django which you can install in VS Code gives you a good boilerplate and makes the work easier so that's why people like Jinja a lot After that, we will see one more thing in this video that how apps are made In Django, the default project you have which is settings.py file and all we don't work on that much every work is done in a separate app Whenever you see a production level app or any app at least one app is made in it even if you are making a website bare minimum but at least one app is made whether you are making a post, blogging platform, social media platform e-commerce, whatever you are making at least one app is made When you make a project in Django you make a project only once after that you never make it again at least during that time you can make multiple projects obviously but the command to run the project once is the start project after that you will always run the start app multiple apps can be in Django in fact, it is So, we will talk about all these things in today's video Let's also take a comment target First of all, if you haven't subscribed yet then do it fast how long will you not do it? We are sitting here If you are coming here then subscribe we will also get a motivation apart from that, our comment target not much let's take a target of 300 comments we have to complete it in 24 hours then we will consider it as a target achievement otherwise, then see we feel a little heartbroken that we are working so hard we are not getting comments we are getting very less share so don't do that do it fast it doesn't take much money it takes less okay let's go with you first of all, we will go to documentation Django's documentation is a very interesting documentation but I think the font size is a little small by default or maybe I am the only one who is used to seeing big fonts so you will go to this you don't need to go to first apps and image you just scroll here you will get different layers how is the documentation organized model layer, view layer we will come to these too now where we want to go is our template layer as soon as you go to the overview of the template layer then you will get here how is Django project configured you can use several template engines in this the most common template engine is DTL Django Template Language and then it is popularly called Jinja as soon as you go to Jinja then you will get this yes, it has a little Japanese touch so Jinja is Fast, Expressive, Extensible Template Language whatever APIs you want to read about Jinja you can read from here if you want to read about high level APIs then here you will get how are the blocks, how is the end string, start string how to apply loops by the way, in the comment section and description I have given a link of a blog article which is available on IOR code in that I have written about all the templates or blocks of Jinja so you can read that too you should read it I have written it in a very organized structure now let's come back to our Django documentation how is Django template language now you will see syntax in the basic page the syntax of Django is very good now you will see where ever you want to insert variables you can insert variables in double curly braces you will see two major syntax one is double curly braces syntax and one syntax where you use one curly braces and one % sign for variables you use double curly braces you always use double curly braces but you will see some places where you use % sign like here, CSRF token we will talk about this too now you will see that we have used some places like here by the way, this is Django extension you can install it that's why I have opened it so that you can see I have opened this extension I will tell you a small setting which is almost necessary in VS Code otherwise you won't get suggestions of HTML I will tell you that too so you will see when we worked on index.html we used % sign load static earlier we didn't have any color feedback after this I installed Django extension usually when I teach Django I uninstall it first time then I install it here it's been a long time since I took bootcamp but we do it like this because there were no variables here you want to load some settings you want to load some special syntax then you can load static like this you are using curly braces and % sign in documentation, the blog article I have written I have told you about these things when it is static, when you want to load something if else, how to use for loop you can read all that we will use it too you will get to know about it so there is nothing to worry there is nothing else there is a small option you can also do piping of things like in upper case and lower case we can also do values like this many times we do it like this it's a very common syntax comments are also given here how to use engines read a little bit as we move forward you will get to know more how we work and how it works so first of all go and read a little the article I have written after so much hard work now we will see how further apps are made in Django because till now the thing I have told you consider it as a directory structure overview we have not done anything special just rendered it with an HTML file now we will see how Django apps are made how they look and how they work so first of all we will open our terminal so let's close it now I am in my environment variable I am in virtual environment first of all my work is to do ls and see if manage.py file is visible if it is not visible then open it and see if it is visible now I have manage.py file if it is not visible then you will not be able to make apps through this file only your server runs through this file only your apps are made the way to make apps is very simple through python we will run manage.py which command to run like run server is a command similarly you have start app if it was create app then it would be better but who are we to judge start app is a starting point of your project it creates the app it is not necessary that you create the app in this way you can do it manually many people used to do it it came later in Django so you can do it manually I will tell you all the steps and process now suppose our app's name is chai it is obvious why will we keep any other name we mostly play with chai or superheroes so this is our chai app as soon as you enter instant you will get some files this app doesn't install anything it just creates a new project and gives you some default files and folders as soon as you see in chai or django we already have a folder named chai or django but a new folder named chai has also come in this chai folder you will see some files we will not talk about migration we will talk about it later you have init file nothing is there admin.py we will talk about it later it is almost empty you will also see apps it is also by default we will talk about it later models also we have models.py we will talk about it later you have test you have views nothing is there as i said django only creates these apps it doesn't install your main project never gets an idea that you have new apps so step 1 after creating these apps write it in notes and put it in comments step 1 is to make the main project aware that we have a new app please check it so what we will do we have to go to settings.py whenever you create these apps they don't have settings.py and they shouldn't have it we will go to chai and django we will open settings.py this is my main file we will tell this file that a new app has come you should be aware of it sometimes cooked in apps also come they are also made aware cooked in means someone else has made it you bring it directly there are many things to be done with customizing so you can see admin, auth, session, message static files, many things are already installed this is called cooked in files django gives you many things already now what i have to do i have to enter a line and name the file you won't get any suggestions here i will reload it and turn off my ais so that we don't face any problem now i have installed an app named chai now you can put a comma just for housekeeping purpose and save it now your project knows that a new app has come named chai now what happened nothing happened but at least an app is properly installed and configured now how to deal with chai the way to deal is you always make views after views you handle url and you serve it on a route so lets make views now to make views you don't want to take views directly you want to load some template because now templating is already there html and all so one more thing our settings.py file as you said you should see templates in templates folder so one thing is better you have a templates folder but every app has a standalone app so many people prefer to put all the templates in that particular app nobody is stopping you many people prefer to make a folder named chai in templates and many people prefer to put it inside chai so that it can be copied and pasted this is also a good approach so lets make a new folder and name it templates templates now i don't need to set any extra settings for this template here is a common industry standard structure that in this template another folder is made which is named by the app this is an industry standard and industry standard varies from company to company so this is a common syntax now what you have done with this chai lets make a new folder and name it now you can see a small problem lets name it all underscore chai dot html now you know what the problem is whenever you want to use any template you don't get it here why? because you have to set extra settings we have never installed any template in VS Code you get it by default if you are from old times then you have to set everything VS Code makes it easy so that you don't have to set anything now what you have to do press control and comma or command and comma and go to settings and here you need emit as soon as you see emit you have to find a section where you can add so this is the section now write dashhtml and valuehtml this is all you have to do by doing this you will get all the emit suggestions but it will still be a jango template because both have html so you have to add some extra settings otherwise you won't get any suggestions so now you will get suggestions so hit exclamatory here it is now our focus is on jinja templating how to understand more templates that's all we have to do so what we will do this is our page all chai page and here you get all types of chai all types of available available chai ok you get all types of chai now when you have the view go to view then go to url close the templates go to views now what you will do you have all the basic render and render so now we will call this view all chai you will take a request here is a method you will call a render what will be the render first element is a request and second is chai now because my folder is chai so inside chai I have all underscore chai dot html common practice so we have kept it here I know in templates it is chai inside chai it is all chai dot html ok hopefully it should be rendered but where? here it is a question now you must be thinking where to get the url because if you see carefully in this new chai app there is no url file it should be there but it is not so what you can do go to chai and django here is url dot py copy this I always do this copy this then whatever app I am making I create a new file same url dot py so here we are paste it now after pasting we come here if you remember we did a small thing here many times urls dot py refers all urls dot py so this is the case when you have apps you want the routing in that app so that the app controls it so what we do we make this sub file but before that we pass the control if you don't pass the control then how will it work so we pass the control how to pass the control this line how to make this line to make this line I have to go to chai and django chai and django's urls dot py listen carefully many times students get confused where I am going from which values so for that you have to remember this diagram this is your main project's url dot py this is all your apps' url dot py so remember it like this now where am I main url dot py now what I have to do I have to transfer the control in an app so for that first of all import the url path with this one more keyword which we call include include now what we have to do leave the path as it is from where you are controlling the website add one more here duplicate this and remove all this now what I have to do I have to say now whatever url you want to make suppose I have chai if anyone hits slash chai then I will pass on a separate control in the same way you can make auth's as well so what we will do is to include a file which file is it transfer the entire control chai dot urls now this is very interesting now the way to read this is a little different you don't have to import anything here the way to read this is whenever you hit chai url then I am transferring the control in an app the settings.py you went to from there only it comes after include so you are transferring the control in an app chai and in chai the urls you are taking the urls here so there is no need to put dot py because this is the templating framework of django through that we are passing the control so we are transferring the control ok so the control is transferred let's save it for a minute so I have from the main project urls.py using django framework I have transferred the control ok so the control is transferred now what to do now if the control is transferred then the responsibility of this url.py will be that how to define the url because it has come on chai after writing some slash chai now the url you wrote there you will write the same url here so we go now close this and go to chai and open the urls.py see the responsibility of admin was not yours so you remove it and I will show you many times by bringing the main file whenever I make an app I copy from there and you leave this path there is no problem and leave these views also because we are taking the views here also here is the views.py now when you are not worried about admin then remove the admin also ok we removed the admin here and I am not worried about the rest of the path so remove this also now what I do now I bring the views so which view do I have as you will write here dot you have a view named all chai I will give the name of this also as all chai this name is going to be very useful in the future when you will pass the variables from the database then this name is very interesting and very useful so now I have defined a url how I have defined the url suppose I have localhost suppose localhost colon 8000 whatever it is after that anyone will go to slash chai so here my routing is happening like this suppose I wanted to make chai slash what can we make chai slash order suppose I was handling the order so I will write like this my view now will be order slash because chai is already there your main url is already there the project one now after that chai if anyone will go to further order so I will write like this order slash and here views dot suppose I have made a view with the name order and here I will give the name of it as order so this is the way to implement them ok we will do it later but I know sometimes you have a curiosity if you don't have curiosity then you don't enjoy reading and if you are enjoying reading then why you are not commenting comment should be there share is on your wish if you do it less but let's move ahead this is our work that how the patterns of url are being made in our pass ok all chai is made and all chai will give the name all chai why will we give the home all chai ok so much work is done now we have the setting of url through main url I will go here from here I will go to views through views I will go to chai so someone will run it yes it is necessary to run so we run our python main manage dot py and we call it run server here it is hopefully file is running so let's come here and somewhere our server will be running let's reload it so we are at slash chai on url our home page is as it is but now we come to slash chai so we have all types of chai available ok it is good that chai is available but it is not fun because this home page was looking good there you were doing in blueish tone and it was looking good and here it is again black and white who likes this so we give solution to this how can we do more now we have all that we had about apps now you can make 1,2,10 apps process is exactly same you work in django 4 or django 5 or you work in any other this is base code line structure this doesn't change the knowledge I had in django 4 is running in django 5 because this is base foundation and this framework is very stable now we come to ok you have done this much now we can know little power about jinja or how it works yes we can know and we will know how our work is done now we make templating once we have defined base structure it should be used everywhere it will be better now every application has basic nav bar is same color scheme is same buttons are same css is same so we will do that work now we open main template I will tell you again and again which template I am opening which url file listen carefully now we have a website and a folder now we make a file in this template you can make inside I will name this file layout.html now how will the html file look I will tell you that first this is basic now a short cut because we have installed django extension now you will see some shortcuts like if you write load then enter now load static is there similarly if you write block then you will get block block unnamed and block unnamed has only one value we will use different but now I am getting shortcuts because I have installed django extension now we make layout file layout means common file you know some things are common like first we have to load static as you are writing static so you got suggestion we loaded static we need load so we have loaded static now we have basic and we need help of extension and all suggestions second thing I need to load static css so now we cheat and get it from index.file because it is not good to write same thing so much cheating is allowed don't load it now I want to overwrite things everywhere this document is written it will not look good title should be different than auth to make title different you can write block we will write unnamed block and we will give title you can give any name now this work that this block can be overwrite when you want default value can be given enter and give default value so give default value if you don't give any value it will be default value I wrote it here you can write anything you can use this block as much as you want suppose we make navbar so we write this is our navbar when I will come in future I will take good navigation bar from bootstrap or tailwind ok this is our navbar now here also I want to write content so we will make unnamed block here it is I will give name as content you can give any name you want it doesn't matter you can give default value but no need to give we can keep it as it is you understood if you don't give value it will be used if you give it will be overwrite so whatever content you give ok you told me it will be replaced but how to use it ok to use layout it is very easy this is my default template now you don't have to write what is written here this is our goal so we come in index file now in this file we will delete everything ok it is deleted first of all answer the question which file you want to extend means which file you want to use as a template some inheritance like if you have read any language we write extends that we are using this class same way we have templating engine that which template you want to inherit so in that case we write extends see how good suggestions we are getting boilerplate is already there it knows that all templates of Jinja are in html so what we will do we will call it layout.html if you have kept it in any folder then layout.html wherever you have kept it ok that's it now whatever variable you want to replace think about them don't think about whole block like suppose here is title this is also a block how will be the differentiation from this title this is their name so what we do we take title this is unnamed block name should be same so we write here homepage now default value will not be there but homepage will be there so as it is it will be copy and this will be paste so you will get only homepage value so this way your blocks will run remember take suggestions if you will write manually then you will do this whole day and don't do that now next is content now you have to change this content so again take unnamed block and call it content now this content is very common keyword everyone write content that's why i am writing now what we have to replace we take simple chai and code and call it homepage now let's see what we have first we go to basic homepage to see what we have done navbar is also there chai and code homepage is also there now what is the benefit this work was happening before now the benefit is i don't have to do this in index html i can do this on any page like suppose we copy this close this close this now whatever app you have made like suppose you have made chai app you have a template in chai all chai.html is there here also you don't have to do this you replace everything again same thing you don't have to change much extends layout.html jango first of all tries to find that template now in your main template it doesn't have layout.html so in next step it will go to your project root structure it doesn't accept defeat like this it will ask is there a template here yes there is a template here is there any layout.html in this yes there is so it will load that and this whole story that it is checking again and again so what is this you went to settings and said this is a folder named templates so by default jango thinks that every app has a template folder in case if not then there can be a template in the root of the project and the name you are giving exactly you have to give that if you give some other name then there is no such searching so you have got to know this basic now see what i have this is all chai page all chai all chai for you and here also we call it chai page ok we have saved this hopefully it should reload now we come here and write slash chai see all settings are available all templates are available common things like navbar are also available now not only this actually if you go to blog article which is in description this is not only that you get only end block and extents infact you get many more things like static you also get url not that we give url by putting href url can be changed so it can't be changed everywhere so we try to compile it programmatically we will discuss about them later that how url is crafted so that you can keep url in navbar and you can change it programmatically so you have to change it in html then why are you using framework if there is any change in program or views then you can't see it automatically and for this in every views in url, the name you see is important that name is important ok so i think you got much interest and fun it was a big video more than half an hour so i think you got more confidence you must have known about tech jargons how it works where i can read more about it how i can know more about it how i can handle errors what is the concept of layout what is the concept of apps when you get to know so much in depth and details then obviously you get more confidence you feel that i know all about framework i have full knowledge about framework where does it hunt things how it sees in first apps template then it goes out so you have a whole way structure your foundation is strong and if you have come to tea then we will believe that foundation is strong i hope you are enjoying this series if you are enjoying then increase my confidence please you comment when you share on twitter or linkedin it feels good to see that someone is reading and supporting otherwise there are many people who read and don't support and then they go like this so they feel that they are asking for a small response so it was good to meet you see you in next video and we will know more about templating and maybe in next video we will discuss about what is the meaning of batteries included in Django see you in next video"
