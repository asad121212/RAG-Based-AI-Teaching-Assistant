    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai Aur Code and our unique YouTube channel where I am teaching you how to develop a full stack through Django Two important things One, we messed up a little in the sequence of series upload which is now fixed, playlist is arranged well and you are getting articles It happens sometimes Actually, what happened is the name of the same video was copied twice so I got confused All responsibility on me I messed it up, no team did it but now it is fixed Second important thing Our platform is now available on chaicode.com You will get all the articles, videos and code files and the platform is now available so the paid codes will also be available so it is almost ready So, what will we see in this video We have seen the basics of Django like templates, routes URLs, when to call them One more major aspect of Django is the models How it interacts with database How the database configuration is in Django We will see all of them from here We will see in this way that you will get 100% confidence that yes, I can also write models If you want to learn more about models then you can learn but I think the best way to learn Django models is through projects because how long you will go in documentation it is not possible So, as and when there is a requirement you can go and learn and if you make a few projects with someone it becomes very good In this model, we will see image upload how Django handles images I think one of the best way that Django handles images is that it keeps images in folders and saves the URL and not just puts the whole image in the DB It is also possible but it is not optimized Let's see Our comment target is 200 comments Not much, just 200 comments Do a little bit You are free now Push the series Let's share the screen and discuss it By the way, I will publish the entire article I have already written the article as a reference guide You will get it You are liking the article a lot Thank you so much for this So, where are we now? This is our VS Code I have activated our virtual environment and where are we now? Let me open it in a browser So, I have opened the browser and you know how to run the command It is very basic It is a simple Python manage.py run server This is our case where we run the server We have not seen much but we have the knowledge that we can keep the templates like this We can keep the templates inside the project like the tea project You can keep the template here We have all tea If you want to see the URL We have learned how to manage the URL We can go directly to the tea How will we know this? We will know it from the main project There are the URLs We are forwarding the redirection or the control of the URL after the tea to the tea.url We got to know about the tea because we have mentioned the tea in the settings.py So, the tea keyword came here and we said that there is a .url So, you can take the URL file So, we got to know it like this Now, we come here We have not worked on the UI We have told you how to use Tailwind I will try to do something more on Tailwind Components are just drag and drop We will see that later Now, we will come back to what else we have to do We have not done anything special yet I will tell you one more thing Now, you can go to the admin But, what happens is that you forget the login id and password Especially, if you are doing the development then it is a very obvious case For this, there is a Python script You can reset it I know that many of you must have got this problem So, we will go to Google And we will call it Reset Django admin password So, run manage.py You will get an option Python manage.py You can change the password of the user or the main db user I think the user was Hitesh Let's try this once Change password Let's run this with the user Let's kill it Python manage.py Change password I think Hitesh was the user's admin Change password Hitesh Password is too similar 8 characters Hitesh 123 Hitesh 123 Password is too similar and it is not giving the option to change it Chai1234 Chai1234 Chai1234 Now, I am happy that Chai1234 is the password Let's run this again and see if we can login to the admin Hitesh Password is Chai1234 Yes At least I am able to go to the admin and we can see that we have only one user Now, what we will do We want to use this admin but we don't have any Chai models So, for the first time, we will interact with the database to see how the database can help us Whenever you want to interact with the database the first step is Whenever you want to make anything data related you don't make it in the main project in the production If you don't make it in the production then why will you make it in the tutorial Here, you don't see the models.py file and it doesn't exist No one creates it The first app we created Remember, project and app are different Project is the whole project App is the small apps You can also call it micro services architecture It is not exactly, but you can call it No one will shout at you that why did you say We go to Chai, which is the new app Here, you have seen by default that you have models.py and admin.py file How are these files routed How are they associated with each other Let's discuss that First of all, for the database You can write models directly Why are you able to write directly? Why is it important to know? That's why you like tutorials Because everything has a detailed discussion It is fun to see Where is it coming from We know the framework like this We have seen it in front of our eyes First thing you see here is db.escolite This is an important file Because we have the whole sequel in it If you go to Chai and Django If you go to settings.py You will see many options here How do you handle the database The database we have is like this Our engine is Django.db.backends.escolite But these engines can be changed In fact, you have a complete URL of how to reset the database You can go and study it It is the best thing that we have been given the same We have escolite 3 But we have access to Postgres You have access to MySQL And MongoDB is also there But it takes a little extra configuration I have seen Django with SQL databases You get the option from here Now we know that we are using SQLite database But we can change the configuration here And put it in Postgres No need to change the code You do not interact directly with the database There is an ORM layer in between We interact with the database through the layer So in one setting you can go from SQLite to Postgres From Postgres to MySQL Now we reach Our main topic We have a lot of questions Now we reach Models.py How to write models in Django You can see that models are imported On the first line We will do all the work through this It is very easy to write models Suppose I write a simple class My model will be ChaiVariety I write the name of the class ChaiVariety My model is ChaiVariety I am making a table How to make this table You can take a dot from the top And take a model How to write a class It is very easy I can write all the fields I can write a name field You can write a name field How to write All are copy pasted We come to models As I have access to it As soon as you put a dot, you will get all the fields There is documentation You can take big integer, average, auto There are many Emails, enums I will tell you something You will get fast learning There are many fields Field depends on the suggestion Which database is active Like in Postgres There are some additional fields You will not get in the suggestion In case you use it, it will give an error Because in configuration, in settings, there is SQLite You are using the field of Postgres The most common field Char field, char field Character field You can pass some default options To know the options Or we will make some projects Then you will know the maximum There is documentation Max length, I need 100 characters In my name After that Image How to handle image For now, let's design the field Then I will tell you how to set For images But images are not supported You have to bring a third party plugin Which is pillow And then you have to do some additional settings To put my images in this folder For now, let's write We only need image field So we give it dot image field And after this image field You will also have to tell Where to upload Suppose I want to upload Now as soon as you save it You will see an error I open it It has said Get pillow at To run the command Python-mpip install pillow So we need pillow Let's go for now So images are handled When you upload your jango images It will put it in this folder You have to set the folder And save that url in the database And save that url in the database Not images Apart from this, suppose I have a field I have to take a date field I have to add date added here To add date, you have to take Timezone libraries But for that too we have jango available In jango, a class called utils Is available Through which you can import a lot of things Like here you see A lot of things are available Our use is simple timezone Let's take timezone Now what is the benefit of taking timezone Now what is the benefit of taking timezone Now I can add timezone in models So models. Now you can add date time field Remember date field is different Date time field is different Date field only gives you date option Date time field gives you date and time option Depends on which one you want to use We will use it according to that So this is our date time field Now I can add default values You can add date time field by default But because I have to add default That's why I needed timezone So here you add timezone And write dot now So now you will get The exact time of now When this model will be created one by one Now suppose I have to add tea types Tea types should also be there Masala tea, ginger tea, ice tea Whichever tea you want So here I want User type to be restricted If you are making for a restaurant Then you will not be giving 1000 types Like I always give example If you are booking seat for airplane Then aisle middle window is the only option You will not give pilot seat So for this common database practice Is to keep enums So suppose I declare a variable Chai type choice And I give it An enum Now in this We will design a tuple So suppose I have ml I give it a name Masala We will duplicate it By putting comma Now next Suppose I have Ginger What will we call ginger Gr Other than that Is there any other So We will name it kl But we will name it kl For kiwi tea We have to give more options If you want plain tea We forgot Here is plain tea And we will keep it simple pl We will take one more I don't like it much But we will keep el For cardamom tea cardamom cardamom cardamom Now I want to design a field Which is highly dependent On these choices Where will we get suggestions We will tell you So I will name it type For type We will give a field So we will take Simple models It will be our care field But we will mention choices We will keep max length 2 because we have kept Abbreviation of 2 And you can give choices Choices are defined above You can give choices A little here By writing indentation type Hmm Let's see There should not be much problem So this is our work Now you have all this available Now we will save This is step 1 How to design models As we move forward You will get to know Data types of models Chair field Images Date field And many more You can see in documentation I have given detailed article In documentation Now we handle our pillow To install pillow We can use command You can use uv Whatever you feel So we will type python M And use pillow PIP install pillow P capital of pillow Remember Now I run server Now there is no problem But now problem is Now you want to keep images To keep images Settings.py should know You will get images You have to set it once Then you can use it in any model You can use it in any app Let's go to settings.py Now here you have to give Media urls So here we give media urls They have to be written exactly the same There is no special option To give them any name You have to give media url Now I am going to take media So media slash It will be exactly the same Now next thing You have to give media root So here media underscore root These two options Settings No one remembers Everyone makes their own notes You can see in blogs The work done above is the same The work done above is static directories Now directories not only have to give path But settings will be same So you can copy from here Everyone does it the same No need to worry You know what you are doing So there is no problem in copying So with base directory Media will come instead of static That's it There is no other work But there is a small thing You have done settings But your urls should also know Because at the end of the day Let's see how to serve This setting Your main project It will be in urls.py Not in particular app It will be in root You can call it root python url It is very easy First you have to import static asset It is very easy We do it here We need from We have to take settings Let's take settings We take jango And load jango configuration From configuration I need static Import and take settings Now you have settings Let's tell you the usage We need one more From jango.conf And We need for urls And static And import static We need two settings There is no exception We have imported two settings How to use them This static method We have to tell From settings This media url Please load it How to write it From url patterns Add one more pattern Via static Static is a method This method will tell We have to load it We have loaded settings This is settings This is settings file We have loaded this settings And we have to take media url You have to write it Media underscore url You know Just now media url We are giving it Plus You have to tell document root Here document You will not get in suggestion Document underscore root Mistake happens I don't know why I have not got in my editor We will take settings And tell Media root But it is written so many times Or it is copied That there are no issues We have told media root And media url In case If your model throws url Please check it We have worked properly Models defined Changed settings Configured url Now how to use The real super power Now I run it Actually The model you have written Your python jango Don't know We have done some changes in database Those changes New tables New models For that We have a step Migration If you remember We have done jango In some settings Make migration When we perform migration We have seen admin Users came Similarly We have to migrate Last time we run one command Migrate Because it was already configured Now You have to create Migration Nothing much Come to python It does all the work Make migration It works with make migration But good practice Migration of your app Migration of your app Or Give command Migration of my app I am working in tea If your co-worker Working in another folder Migration of all should not be We said make migration As soon as you create migration You see a new folder In this new folder Init.py and initial migration Let's see We have seen It is writing sql It is writing sql Same care field Big auto integer Primary keys That's why When you use models You never interact with sql Same code file If you want to go to my sql Or postgres Command is same Make migration Django Or sql This is Django's superpower Now We have understood What is in migration Let's migrate Migrate Migrate Migrate Available As a table If you have sqlite viewer I don't have sql But you can see Plugin is there But how to use I have told you Now let's tell you About Django's superpower You will get a file Admin.py Here it is Through admin.py You can attach any model And see in admin Superpower Subscribe Comment Share Like Comment Share Like Comment Like Share Admin is there Let's import model .models .models .models Import You can import different classes We have only Chai variety Now Register this model To register in database One line code Take site from admin And register Register Chai variety Not a single line Now You can see As you go to admin And reload Manage.py Run server And you can see Chai varieties Chai varieties Spelling mistake It's ok Now you can add All fields You can see You can see All fields In enums Masala tea Name Small Ginger Ginger tea File File File Chai code PNG Date time Now You can Change Save Chai variety object Chai variety object Not good It would be better It would be better Let's do it In models.py At the end of class You can change Simple code Def Def Dunder Dunder Dunder Not much Not much Return Return Self Name Save Save Save This is also Configuration What are the options What are the fields You can see Completely manageable In short Let's add one more Suppose Large Masala tea Large masala tea Let's bring One more image Let's use this This is Masala tea Save Now we have Two chai available It's good We understood How to bring values How to add them How to register Almost everything You know This is done This is how database is managed You like big videos So I will not stop here Otherwise It's already big Let's go ahead I would have made more I have made so many videos Now Things are in database But it's not only in database We need This template All chai I want to show it It will be better Database is set But I want to bring values On front end How to do it We go to views.py We have a field Chais All chais We take a request And forward values How? It's easy Chais All chais We will see later What I do It's simple I want to bring chai variety And see it I do Chai variety I want chai variety suggestions I have But sometimes it's not Why not Forgot to import How to import From Dot models Import Chai variety Now We have Chai variety Because it's ORM You don't need to write sql It has documentation You have many options What you can do Clean field Primary keys Validate Many options You get many options For interaction You use objects And then you give operation Aggregation Accounts Many options I think no one knows But not many One option in db All Now It will query Chai models It will give All Arrays You should know What data type You are expecting To loop To extract values Or display You have to pass A third parameter Chai Variable Chai This is your work How to transfer values In frontend Now You have to handle values In frontend How to handle It's not difficult To handle Values I will tell you And Styling In templates I have all chai We made it in last video And If we Copy it We have Chai And we are loading All chai In urls We are loading all chai All chai All chai for you Now I will introduce One more block This is for block For Suggestion Loop block Block Unnamed How to use I am thinking It's better It's not working Ok We can take unnamed block It's gone What to do Enter Now we are using For loop End for This is our end for Mess up With suggestion And For loop How to write For keyword Variable Chais Chais Array Object.all For chai In chais Chais Object As it is Now In every chai You have access We are using Div And in this div You can use Class We don't have Class Chai dash item We will write Chai item class Now How to Take data Especially image data Chai dot How to take image Inject a variable Inject Which is your variable Chai We have image In database Or models We have image Whenever you store image You have to write url That's it Save Refresh We need to get Issues Ok I think We need to get Issues Oops What is the mistake It is simple We are loading content But We are not loading So i tried Nothing I think My block is not rendering If we see Template Layout We are loading Content No one knows It is easy Cut Add Inject Save Content Now We start tailwind We have installed Tailwind Cd Chai django Python Tailwind On the go Styling Not much But little Let's start First Inside or outside Div Inside div We can give tailwind classes Basic classes Grid Grid-col Columns Gap Gap-4 Div Div Div Grid Grid Margin Margin-allside Margin Now We can apply Styling Not much Little Rounded Looks good Still And Instead of chai item We can give background color Bg- Gray 500 And Little here Margin-5 No Sorry Padding-5 Margin-5 Not good Little Light 200 Looks bad Try other color Green Or blue Blue-500 Little dark Looks good Ok You can do it Little time But looks good And You can give other classes Simple Text-Excel To excel Font-Bold Font-Bold Ok Not bad And Here Rounded Rounded Ok Not bad And Shadows Shadows Shadows-LG Looking good Not bad Now You know How to show Data Now We will Show button First A tag Will show How to handle A tag Simple button Will show Two variables In this button ID Type And ID Because Database gives you ID Now Add some classes I have many classes Ok First Type equals Button Class Added all classes Now Button is available You can block Button Block Block Inline flex Width 100% Width dash 100% Ok Not bad It's ok Could have been improved Now Button is not working How to Work with button Ok We will come back Close I will give you One more iteration So that your journey is settled Now Our next goal Is to add one more data field It will be easier Suppose You have given a good type But my tea has no description Or no pricing I will add one You add one Description Add pricing And see the number field Research it Now add models And take a text field You have many options But If you add only text field You will get a compulsory field If you have data already Clean all data Add new data If you want If you want You have two options Default If no one has Add it in all fields Ok You have added models It means You have to perform How It is very easy First make migrations Because model has changed As soon as I enter Migrations are done You can see What else has been added Dependency Migration Add field Migration is done Now you have to Migrate You can see We are coming here Refresh Now I will refresh How will it work If server is not working Run server Hopefully it is working Are you also working Now we go here I have a description field Available here Now Description field is available Now I want Suppose If I click on this button I go to a new view And in that new view I see the description Now I want this much detail And obvious thing Click on the details Let's see How it performs If you go to details You need a new view If there is no view How will it get data First go to view All chai is there But if you want to go to new view Go to view and add method What is the name Chai underscore detail Here you go In detail You know You are getting a request And whoever comes on this URL Will bring a chai id How will it bring But a chai id will come There are many ways to give id But in this case You click You see a new id in the URL And on the basis of id The data is loaded Now I need a new chai variable Which goes from database And on the basis of id Brings the full detail The method you will use the most Is through Django shortcuts Let's bring it From Django shortcuts You have to bring Import And this method is called Get list or 404 Depends on what you are using If you don't get the full array Then give 404 If we have the object Then bring the object Otherwise bring 404 We will use get object or 404 You have to pass two things You have a manager And a query set Basically I have to pass chai variety From this model And you have to give the primary key What is the value of the primary key My value is chai id Which I will get easily You can put more filtering You can put data check Chai id type is exactly That is basic After that Return You will render But what will you render Request is ok I will give you But there is no template So let's make a template Right click new file And let's call it Chai underscore detail Details Dot html Now at least I have a data So let's give it to the data So inside the chai folder I have given a file Chai underscore detail Dot html Now We have to pass the object We have learned this above We have done chai before We will pass chai And we will do in quotes Here is chai What will be the value We have done one thing View will come like this It is a very good thing But View does not work alone I will click here You should know where to go What to load You are absolutely right You told me Now we go to our url And tell that url That something new has come Handle this too Ok Let's duplicate this First handle path You will get primary keys in path By default database You can configure it But we have by default In db Integer type keys So in path If we have an integer What will I treat that integer I will call it Chai underscore id Exactly chai underscore id You have to put slash It is not a special option It is called diamond bracket You have to keep it in it Chai id is because When views are coming here You are calling it chai id If you call it something else It will be a mess You have to load views We have brought all views We do not have all chai We have chai detail I will change the name You will get the impact of this name This name is very important We do a lot of work through it Ok Now we have done this work I know views How will it behave after going there How will the url look I know that too But Now the chai html we have made Chai detail How will the values come in it We handle it too It is very easy There is no rocket science in it First of all Let's copy paste Let's bring it all Or at least Let's bring it all Let's paste it And the useless ones Let's remove it End for div Remove it all Let's manipulate it We have to extend the layout You can write chai detail page We have content here Let's call it chai detail page Chai detail page Technically We should have Whenever I go after chai And write 1 I get chai detail page Now step 1 If I take 1 from here It should reach to next page If I take 2 from here How to do it It will be done Through our anchor We come to all chai template If you remember I used a tag here But now I don't need hash I need a dynamic url Let's remove it And inject templates Not variables These are templates We inject templates Now what will be done Next I have to use url There are ways to use url How to use url Along with url You have to give a name We have to see documentation First of all Where will url go I don't know So whenever url goes We have given a name All chai detail When you use url Then You can use url with name Which we never used Copy And bring this name All chai Go to this url Otherwise it becomes difficult But best way is Whenever you define url Define name of url So that you can reuse it But along with that You can send a string Put it in quotes This is a string Now what other parameters You have to send See We are in loop You can also put a dot id So that it's id reaches you Now save it Reload it Now see You have chai slash 1 Here chai slash 2 Click here So i have 1 Now you know the relation That from url this thing is coming here We also enjoy reading like this Ok This is all about details Now the issue Easy thing On chai detail You have to display values How can you do it It's very easy Because now i don't have to put a loop You have a variable And print the details That's right Let's print a description Suppose it's an h3 And i have to insert a variable And in that variable I know chai is available And i have Description I haven't written description yet I haven't So let's print the name Let's print the name So here Large masala tea And here ginger tea Now i go Here And add description This is description for Large Masala tea Copy Save And for small ginger tea Description for Small Ginger tea Save Now i can add description So just below h3 We write a paragraph And tell it to insert a variable And because i know variable Chai is available So after this Description I think i have to reload Editor Refresh Now we have description So let's make a card And display it You can use Bootstrap and other tools But This task is for you Now you know You can take all properties And data for a particular url We have made a url This is a complete project This is a database You have options How you can go You can add data fields You can manipulate You can give values When we come to home page We have all cards After card list You can click on any card Now for you Assignment Assignment is I don't have pricing You can add it in a string Someone has a 50rs pricing Someone has a 60rs pricing I should see pricing in a pill After that improve the card After clicking A big card should come With a big image Below that image Description Pricing And a back button I think you enjoyed How it is detailed It is a very interesting project By the way I will add the source code In the website ChaiCode.com So that you can get All the source code And very soon When the project will be over It will be published on github I hope you enjoyed This video is very interesting We have discussed a lot about models About urls And how fast we are becoming a full stack developer That too in python See you in the next video"
