    "text": " Hello, how are you all? Welcome to Chai or Code and we are continuing our Django series. It's going well and you all supported us a lot. A lot of people are sharing and being stingy but what can we do about it? But thank you so much for those who shared and those who help us achieve our target in the comments Thank you for those who comment and those who are not doing anything then what can we say about them? Let's talk to you because you are the ones who promote this channel on Twitter and LinkedIn and we are growing with a lot of growth So in this video let's move ahead in our Django series There were some people who were spreading rumors that Sir has ended the Django series What? Yes, we will end it when we come and tell you Anyways, you all already know me those who follow me regularly So what will we do in this video? In this video, we will take Django one step ahead. If you remember we had read about Django's models and retrieved data from those models and deployed it on the front end Many of you have made really good cards and shared them on Twitter and LinkedIn So those who do this and are working and engaging those people can work and the rest are sitting on the sofa so you should also work In this video, we are talking about relational databases Django is mostly with SQL databases Right now we are using SQLite but the same interface is used for MySQL, Postgres or any other SQL databases Django gives you a wrapper through which you can talk to the database and not directly and this is a good thing that the database can be replaced under the hood In this video, we will talk about relations the one to many relations of the database and how all these relations can be used in the work We will see it in the code directly so that things are easy After that, we will show you the admin interface and will also show you the customization of the admin interface and finally, we will introduce you to forms which is a new topic but you will enjoy how Django handles forms and how you get built-in forms You just need to write their CSS and your work is done So let's start Comment target? Yes, thank you so much for asking It is not much, it is a target of 400 comments As soon as the target of 400 comments then only the new video will come Let's see how much time it takes If it takes a week, then the video will come after a week If it takes 3 days, then the video will come after 3 days So it depends on how fast you get 400 comments completed Because if there is no engagement then make some other kind of videos So you take care of that thing So let's share the screen with you So let's share the screen with you Now let's see how we can handle it This is our application Let's open it We are running it in Python So first of all we activate the virtual environment We should see the virtual environment We should see the virtual environment ls-la ls-la Is our virtual environment deleted? Oh nice! Our virtual environment is deleted Let's see What happened to us? Ok, we are back Actually I opened the wrong folder So I fixed the folder And now we can see that we have our virtual environment By the way, for those who don't know that we have launched a new website docs.chaicode.com Some people had a problem with this that what is the big deal in this new documentation Ok, you don't have to see it So now you can get the attached documentation of this video You can see the whole section of Django When you are watching this video you will see a new tab Just click on it And you will get all the documentation along with the detailed guide and source code So you don't have to worry You will get all the documentation Will you get a good habit of reading the documentation? Tell me in the comments Is it a good habit to read the documentation? Or is it a bad habit to ask who reads the documentation? So what we do is We enable the virtual environment I have already discussed the source in windows So we go to .venv We go to .venv We have the activate script It is activated And we come to python Let's see where we are ls cd chai django And in this python manage.py run server Hopefully, our server should be running And it is looking good Now we go to admin Because we will work on admin Hopefully, if I remember the password chai1234 Yes, I remember the password I didn't expect So we took chai varieties And we had 1-2 chai varieties Large masala tea, small ginger tea We had this kind of chai Let's add one more chai So that we can see what is happening We don't have large, small, medium So we Medium Medium Masala Tea We also need an image So let's add an image And we add Yes Let's add the image of our new course What is the type? Masala Date is now And Medium size Tea DSA with javascript New course It is good Let's save it And small ginger medium Now let's come to the source code Now we have to follow a lot of strategies It is not that we can Innovate anything randomly It is a framework We have to follow guidelines And there are guidelines to learn the framework So first we will talk about relationships We will not talk about form now We will talk about it later So first We are talking about relationships There are not many relationships in SQL First is one to many Second is many to many And then one to one Now you have two models Or two entities Like tea and review Now what can be the relation Between tea and review One tea can have multiple reviews One review can't have multiple teas So we have to see What can be the values Suppose we have a tea And a store So one tea can be available in multiple stores And in one store Multiple teas can be available So it is a many to many relationship So instead of studying these relationships in theory You might have studied it When you have studied database We study it in code It is easier and you will learn to write code And you will know the relations So I will tell you one by one On which relation we are working So that it will be easy So we come to our tea model By the way we already had a tea model We will copy it and show you How it looks Our model is not that good But the one you made was very good So this is tea It is not that bad But the one you made Was no doubt one of the best And the photos of tea were also good So what we do We open the tea folder And go to models.py Now you know that We have already made a model with the name of tea Now what we do We try to make more models How can we have more models One thing if you have noticed Already I can directly create an account in Django I can create an account and log in So by default in Django There is a table named user model There is a user table Which you can utilize You can associate and modify Where do you get it This is the most important thing To get it you have to take it from Django I will turn it off Our toggle So we say Django In Django you will get Contrib In this contrib also you will get auth And from this you can extract The models No need to do this No need to do this Yes people say What is the need of documentation What is the innovation So no problem So I got this user There was no need but for now it is fine Now what we do We talk about the models one by one Which models are you talking about And why is it right Or it relates to us So first we come to one to many What is the meaning of one to many There is one entity And there is multiple Entities in my left hand There can be multiple entities What can be the most basic Tea reviews can be So we come to tea review Now in tea review Same thing This is basic There is no rocket science innovation In one models.py You can define multiple classes Now we come to tea reviews How reviews Modeling of reviews Is almost same The fields are same We will not talk about two fields The rest of the fields are same Rating, integer, comment String, text Date also So it does not matter First thing is tea Because every review should be on tea And it is So what we will do We will bring a foreign key from models So foreign key means Which person I am talking to Primary key means My own key My identity My Aadhar card, my PAN card But when I am talking to you What is your roll number What is your unique identity So for foreign key First you have to tell the model Which model are you talking to So I have given foreign key So first thing is Which model am I talking to You are talking to tea variety So I have written tea variety If it is in any other file Then import it Now we come to Tea variety I will consider it foreign key So good thing about Django You don't have to tell Which field you are attaching You pass ID So you can see in this way And these are design decisions One you will see many times On delete So what to do with tea review Delete it with the above model Keep it as it is Because they are being associated So mostly you will see Cascade effect Use this On delete cascade And you have to bring it Cascade will not come like this We need cascade Now This is your assignment Cascade is a very basic thing What happens Now your assignment is You have to find out what is cascade In the database And find out and tell me in the comment section Tell on twitter Write a small 5-7 line You have to do assignment We will not let you sit here for free We will get you to do the work Otherwise we are teachers So you have to find out What is cascade and tell me If you want You can give a related name Related name It has always been fruitful In my experience As I told you When we were giving name in urls It was easy in views So in the same way It will be easy That's it Now exactly On the same work You can see here We take the user We associate the user Because when we learn so much We have one more model We inject foreign key Who has to inject foreign key We have to inject user Where did the user come from We have taken the user from the top Now on delete We have to give Models.cascade Something related to delete You can see If you can't tell We will tell in the next video Now in your model You have to keep the regular fields You have already read a lot about them Keep the integer field I keep the integer field directly Your assignment is As we read last time You have to keep 1,2,3,4,5 If you want to keep rating strictly You can do that Now we come to comment We give the comment You can take the string field We take the text field You can give as much as you want We give the text field Now we keep the date added field We keep the date We will keep the date We take the date time field From the models We keep the default value We keep the default We have already kept the default We will remove now See how much repetitive That's why we say Once you understand the code Then it is repetitive Now we saw If we write this line Then what happens It looks good in the database It doesn't look like an object We bring a dunder string Dunder string And We bring the self And we return We bring the return in formatted string There are different variations This is a classic python You can bring it as you want I inject Here Like this And we say self. And user. User name So that we know which user We are giving Next we write For which tea So self.tea Which field We take from the tea We take the name We are taking the field So this is our work How you get One to many relations I think now there is no problem You have a very easy work Now you have understood Now let's read the next Now we come to Many Many to many Like i gave you an example Store is one of the best example One tea can be in many stores And many types of tea can be in store So when both can be many So we keep it Like this So store We made store Here models.models Here we have Tea Now what we do You don't have to do much When many to many Then you want to use it in fields So see What sense it makes for us First of all, there should be a name of the store So let's handle it Models.carefield Let's take carefield And let's say max length Should be 100 So here is your max length Let's take carefield Which is the place In which you have opened the store So models.carefield And let's make it 100 As such there is no requirement To make it 100 Here is the max length But we do Oops, what happened Let's close it Now what we need is Tea variety Tea varieties Now its admin interface Is the best So what we can do We can tell Django directly That there is a many to many relationship As we told here That it is foreign So it understood that it is foreign So it was a very easy task You decide whether it will be one to many or one to one It depends on the logic But when you have such a relation That it can be many to many So it gives many facilities And it gives you the option To mark many to many fields Which field to mark many to many With whom to mark So I want to do with tea variety So here is tea variety And giving related names Is always good So I give it stores That I will give relation with stores Related name You will see here That we gave related name here So you always give the name of the model That I In the other table Which name I want to go So here also In the other table I want to go with stores You will go directly with store name But it is good to mention It will be very interesting You will say that it is very good So let's bring the dunder string Here is our dunder string And I have to see Because it is very big So let's remove it We will not do much We will leave it by writing self.name Now we have One to one field Now what can be one to one field Suppose Every field will be associated with one Only one relationship can be made So suppose If you are giving certificate to tea So one certificate can be associated with one tea Student also has same So every student has One unique certificate So what we do We make certificate for tea We just want to understand Now you can say anything So let's write here That this is one to one method We are reading here Let's scroll a little Class and let's say Tea certificate Certificate This is our model This is our model We have model It was very basic So let's take tea Now what we do in tea We will say this is one to one field These are two complex fields Many to many And one to one field You can give reference in jango That this will be one to one field All the restrictions to be injected All that work jango will do You don't have to pay attention to more restrictions We have to do one to one field with tea We have to do with tea variety That is our tea variety We have to give on delete We will use same models.cascade Because you will read about it And also give related name That what name should i go inside that table Or in reference of that table So certificate is a very good name And it will be repeated Now we want that every certificate Should get a number So certificate Should get a number We are not putting any restrictions We put in business logic That every certificate should get a unique number Now i will take care field And max length 100 And this is our 100 You can see how you have to do I will also write issue date Issue underscore date Usually with certificates Issue date And same we have to take field Date time field Date time field Date field And same default value Will be from time zone Now after writing model You will feel that i am writing It is like this Let's write valid date Valid underscore until It is on you Write it or not There is no load Models.date time field And we don't give any default value We keep it as it is Now with this We bring dunder string Copy it from above Copy and paste Now we change it a little Formatted string And we call it Certificate for So that it is written easily in admin For whom it is Self Dot name Name dot chai For this field So now our models are ready Hopefully if we have not done any typo You must have got a lot of ideas Let's give you a quick summary We made models We studied in detail In this video we started Relationship study One to many was very easy You just give foreign key Our reviews Will be associated with some chai Many to many We get the option Many to many Admin interface Any field You can go One to one field You get the option One certificate One chai Restriction Jango will keep it Can we move forward No Because here you have to Stop Because admin has to update Before updating admin Migrations have to be done Because it will not show in admin It does not know what you have changed in models Very easy In python Take manage.py script Make migrations This script will be removed Whenever you will make a bug in database First make migrations You will see Migrations If you want to read sql You can see All sql Models Store Many to many Very easy Next When migration is done Now we have to migrate So that everything goes in database You have just written sql Migrate All operations are done If not, debug errors Migration is done Now i can call python as run server But now If i go to admin panel And refresh I do not have any option What are you doing You know For this we have to Go to admin.py Last time When we were doing admin.py We only brought model We can do this But i think If we take it to next level You will enjoy Let's modify it First Import all models From models Bring tea review Store And tea certificate I want all this In admin First Define a class You can do it in admin panel Suppose Tea review Inline In this class In admin Imported If you remember You have many options How you can See this model Auto discover Field list filter On jango admin You can Make a mini series Or detailed crash course We will try to cover as much as possible But you will see an option Tabular inline This option Does not make it sensible As you see in admin You will know We will keep two options I want to inject this model In this class Tea review In reviews I want to give a feature in admin Where i see tea review I will get extra field Maybe i want to put two reviews In one place Maybe you want to Add one tea at a time You want to get one, two, three boxes You want to add as many tea as you want Just for fun You can do this But you will see two fields In one place We have more tea reviews We will add tea variety In a particular class It will be easy We have it now We have tea Tea Tea variety And tea variety admin We will keep Same thing Models Admin There are many things in admin Most common is model admin Whenever classes are made Tabular inline is one exception Mostly you will see model admin Whenever you want to Customize in jango admin Or enable or disable This is the syntax Admin.model admin How can you modify in this Most common thing List display Read docs List display When you see admin Which is clickable Which is not List display List display List display links Let's play with list display This is a tuple If you want to give single field You remember this If you are giving one field You have to add We can display two three fields Name Type Date Added When you are adding date added Remember that field should be there If not Error will come We have date added We have added that field That's all You can add inlines Inlines Again We will do Chai Review Chai review Inline Sometimes it stops Chai review inline We will tell you how Chai review inline Impact I know it's new But when i will make admin It will be easy Don't worry We will make store admin Now it's repeat Take same admin Because we are doing customized class You will take model admin Which field you want to add List display It's all repetition Tuple Name and location It's all same Location One more interesting thing In admin You can add Filter horizontal You will get filters I think You can see You can add filter in admin You don't have to do anything You can add filter on your choice Chai underscore Varieties You can add filter on your choice You can add filter on your choice It depends On database model You can add filter on your choice Add admin So that we can finish our work And then We can add Let's show you How it works Chai certificate admin Chai certificate admin Same thing Admin Admin And All fields List display So that you can see Difference Chai List display Chai And Certificate Underscore number We don't have certificate number It's important to see Certificate We have certificate underscore number We will see other fields later We have saved this much But it won't work Because you have written customized classes If you have written only model You can register it Now you have to give Which model you have written And which class you have injected We already had chai variety And we have injected chai variety admin So Chai variety admin Similarly You can see other fields What else Let's remove What else we want to store Store Store admin One more duplicate And Chai certificate And Chai certificate admin What is the name Chai certificate admin Chai certificate admin Now you can see One thing We have done chai review inline Means You can't give direct review Because for review you need reference Of which chai you are giving That's why we have used inline That's why admin is tabular inline Again, it's not making sense It will make in a minute Let's run it I think Let's restart In case there is any typo Let's fix it Must be a list or tuple Where is the list or tuple We have erased it Let's check it Okay You know all the tuples Here were two and here was only one So we need one comma Hopefully we still have it Chai certificate And where is it Chai varieties is not a field of chai store Let's check it Okay Let's check it in one minute Because chai varieties is not a table But let's check it in one minute I think our server is working Because it's important Let's clear it Let's reload Now we can see Chai certificate is with you Chai varieties is with you Let's check it First of all Let's see how chai review inline This tabular inline As soon as you go to chai variety You will see When you add a new chai Let's add variety You can see reviews section This is called inline You have injected the model In existing We have written chai review inline Because I want to inject Chai review inline So we have injected it easily As such there is no problem Chai review admin tabular inline Okay I think it's basics And I think it's clear And in case if you are getting confusion How did it know That I have to go to chai review We did this work in models As soon as we made reviews We said you have only one foreign You can go there As soon as you said you have to go inline So it reached here Now let's add a new chai You will see reviews in it And see here two fields are getting Because we said that our admin I want to give two extra fields If you give three, you will get three If you give one, you will get one You have got all the fields here Date when added, time when added From drop down your user is also coming So all this work is the super power of admin Type and all this was there You can give rating and comment So this is our basic first step Next we said Chai variety And we are adding chai variety admin So this was just basic There is nothing much to see Chai variety Okay let's go back Chai variety was the same We have not changed any display Name type and date Were added So name type and date added In case if you want to see its visual So suppose if I remove this for a minute So let's cut this Save it And we have only name and type Let's bring it back So here it is You have also got date added So this is how admin customization is done Now you can see Which one is clicking and which one is not For that we have given list display List display links So that you can click on which all And make which all clickable Store admin This is very interesting Because it is many to many As soon as you go to store As soon as you add a new store So what we can do in store How to add values So suppose we make a Jaipur tea store Location Let's keep it Jaipur And say Add me ginger tea So we have I think Add tea variety So we don't have tea variety Let's fix this too Yes, we are back Welcome to real world development Where such bugs come And you have to fix it on the go So it was a typo bug But I would like to give you a walkthrough So if you remember A minute ago we commented this filter horizontal Let me show you Because tea varieties It was not working here I thought we will handle it later But obviously as soon as we went to the store admin There started to be a problem Now as soon as I go to the store So I add the store This interface is not like I wanted to show you And it is not working Because the filter has to be horizontal Otherwise how will the store admin work So I told him Now it's time to handle it So I started debugging it To debug it, first of all uncomment it He said that now we have a lot of issues Now for filter horizontal The store admin model has to be seen So if you look at the store model You want to see Related name is stores But this many to many field What is it called It is called tea varieties So we are bringing tea varieties from here And injecting it here So now I think you know the relation better See, many people may not like it But real world development is like this You also need to know this process It is not that easy Whether you are making a tutorial or a project You learn things like this When you see that the other person is also struggling He also has to do debugging I remove everything from editing with magic No, no, it is directly from day 1 But it does not happen Real world development is like this So let's go, we saved tea varieties So as soon as we saved it, I thought Yes, it was typo, it is fixed there Now here you can see How these two fields are working And how they are coming And I think this is the most The superpower of many to many relationship That you go inside the store As soon as you add the store Now you see inside the store How easily tea varieties and this can be linked So suppose we have a store Our Jaipur store Jaipur Tea store Location is obvious Now here you can tell In Jaipur tea store We have small ginger tea And we have large ginger tea But not medium So we said okay, you tell Whatever variety of small ginger tea you have So it told here Now you can save it So your store is ready If you want, let's make another store Let's make a Delhi tea store Let's make it Its location is Delhi And it has only Medium tea And it is saved Now you want more Store, location, variety You can see it easily So this is our work How admin works And all the varieties of admin It is quite complex But in one video we got an overview How admin is configured How all relationships are configured And most importantly How admin can be configured So we have added all these things in the tea app So many things Okay So let's do one thing So many things have been added And a small assignment has come for you So let's end this video here I wanted to add more forms But I think Let's do this much for now Because the video has become lengthy It has been almost 40 minutes Some bugs have come, fix them So let's try In the next video, let's talk about forms Database, admin, relations I think it's over Now you just have to make a project And your polishing will be done So I think you must have found it very interesting Especially the debugging part Which I did not edit So give me feedback on it I will disappear all the magic from editing And everything is fixed at once Or you want this kind of experience Show us your struggle How did you debug How did you trace the stack Where can there be a problem We want to know that thought process and mind process Tell me in the comment section See you in the next video In the next video, we will discuss forms It will be more fun"
